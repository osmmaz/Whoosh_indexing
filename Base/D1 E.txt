
The telephony over IP (ToIP) is becoming a new trend in technology widely used
nowadays in almost all business sectors. Its concepts rely on transiting the telephone
communications through the IP network. Today, this technology is implemented inside a
number of universities and research laboratories connected to the National
telecommunications Network for Technology, Education and Research (RENATER) which is
the French academic network.
In order to interconnect the telephone systems already installed in these academic sites,
an experimental testbed has been successfully implemented. This testbed is based on a call
routing server using SIP protocol.
After checking this testbed functions and preparing a state of the art on its technologies,
a second step consisted to implement a phone call routing pilot service for the (RENATER)
community. Based on this context, I achieved my internship graduation.
The main objectives of my internship were:
to study possible evolutions of the current testbed to deploy the pilot service
to study and implement a solution for monitoring the current pilot service
to study and implement a calling accounting system
Securing the pilot service
This report is the result of 4 months of the work I achieved inside the SIPA team (IP
advanced services and prospective) of GIP RENATER.
