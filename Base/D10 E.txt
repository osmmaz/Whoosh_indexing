This thesis describes the polarographic analysis of penicillin and cephalosporin. Quantitative methods have been developed for the analysis of ampicillin, amoxicillin and cephalexin. These methods are based on the formation of the complexes of double nickel and cobalt with antibiotic or disintegrating products, especially dai ketobiprazine derivatives. The optimal conditions for the systems of the double ampicillin and amoxicillin complexes were studied in terms of pH, acidity, electrolyte solution, temperature and time effect. The range of standard curves was under optimal conditions. Reversal experiments The polar interaction showed that polar reactions can be reflective and contain one electron transition. Both cobalt and nickel complexes were compared and the latter was best analyzed. An appropriate method of analysis was also developed by the composition of 5.2 dimethyprazine derivatives of amoxicillin. The methods were tested on the products of some pharmaceuticals and the results were compared to the pharmacological methods and found a good match between them.
