The application of pulse decay method has been extended from linear
core plugs to full diameter whole cores. A mathematical model, which
incorporates the slippage effects, has been developed to solve the problem of
transverse, unsteady compressible fluid flow through whole cores.
Experimental set up has also been constructed for performing pulse decay
experiments on whole cores. A numerical model adopting a curvilinear grid
has been developed to solve the governing non linear flow equation. Based
on this numerical solution, a data analysis computer program has also been
developed which calculates the permeability and Klinkenberg factor from
measured pulse decay experimental data using non linear regression
technique. Pulse decay experiments were conducted on sandstone samples
under the conditions where the data were influenced by gas slippage effects,
using gas as the pore fluid. A technique has also been presented for the
estimation of permeability and Klinkenberg factor from multiple pressure
pulse decay tests. The obtained results are compared with the conventional
steady state values. The proposed method is much faster and easier to
perform as compared to the conventional steady state method and can also
help detect core heterogeneity.
