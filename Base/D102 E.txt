Since their introduction in 1998, the applications of space time trellis codes have
been, and still are, increasing rapidly. In this thesis, unequal error protecting ST
trellis codes are designed then used to transm it images over a rapid fading channel.
The idea is to use ST trellis codes that provide strong error protection to one of
its multiple input bits and send the important part of the image through that bit.
This requires modifying the existing performance measurement techniques such
th at they show the weight of error protection on each input bit. This is done
using a modified transfer function and new upper bounds for each individual input
bit. To find the desired codes, two approaches are used: design and exhaustive
search. Both approaches are used to find several QPSK and 8PSK codes that
provide strong error protection properties to the most significant bit. To complete
the application, the JPEG image processing technique is modified to separate the
important from the less im portant bits. Finally, test images are simulated using
the new codes in addition to several codes from the literature for comparison.
