For decreasing greenhouse gas (mainly CO2) emissions, several approaches have been
evaluated and reviewed for capturing CO2 in the utility industry, namely Carbon Capture
and Storage technology (CCS). As a promising CCS technology, oxy fuel combustion
can be used in existing and new power plants. There are two main approaches available
to utilize the oxy combustion technology, one of them is the use of air separation units to
separate O2 which will be used in the combustion process and the other application is the
ion transport membrane (ITM) reactor technology. The objective of this proposed work is
to study in details the above mentioned two approaches for applications in oxy fuel
combustion technology. For the application of the first approach, experimental and
numerical investigations on an atmospheric diffusion oxy combustion flame in a gas
turbine model combustor are conducted. The combustor is fuelled with CH4 and a
mixture of CO2 and O2 as oxidizer. A wide range of operating parameters was considered
aiming to determine the stability limits of the oxy combustion diffusion flame and
characterize the flame in detail. The experimental and numerical results showed that the
stability of the oxy combustion flame is affected when the operating percentage of oxygen in the oxidizer mixture is reduced below 25  . For the application of the second
approach, from our understandings of the oxygen permeation and oxy fuel combustion
characteristics that come out from a 2D analysis of a simple symmetric ITM reactor, a
new 3D reactor design is introduced for the substitution of ITM reactors into a gas
turbine combustor. A new oxygen permeation equation model has been developed by
fitting the experimental data available in the literature for a LSCF ion transport
membrane. Based on the 3D analysis, the present proposed monolith structure design
ITM reactor is capable of delivering power ranging from 5 to 8 MWe based on cycle first
law efficiency.
