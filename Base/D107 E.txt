Dramatic advances in electronic and computer technology have led to the advent
of what has been termed as the information age. These days, information
is readily available through electronic and networked media in colossal quantities
and on an enormous variety of subjects. This information explosion has
resulted in a great demand fo r efficient and effective means fo r organizing
and indexing the data, so that we may retrieve useful information when it
is required. One such area is that of document indexing. Researchers have
long advanced this subject, especially fo r the English language. Very little has
been done on Arabic. In this thesis, we are concerned with indexing Arabic
text. In the literature we found that most of the work done in Arabic information
retrieval is based on the concept of stemming and many algorithms
or approaches are proposed. In this thesis, we are concerned with retrieval of
information based on semantic o f the words. So, we developed a system for
the Arabic document retrieval based on the idea of Latent Semantic Indexing.
Latent semantic indexing does not require a lot of rules or root derivation
algorithms. In addition, results show that latent semantic indexing performs
well with respect to precision and recall.
