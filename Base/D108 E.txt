Arabic font recognition is the process of recognizing the font of a given text image. It
may be needed as a preprocessing phase to an Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system which enables it to identify the font of text and then use the pre trained models of
the specific font for the text image. Arabic font recognition has not been studied as
extensively as OCR despite of its importance in improving recognition accuracy.
A successful Arabic font recognition prototype is designed and developed. Since there is
no available database of multi resolution, multi font, multi size, and multi style text
images; this research includes building a database of 20 Arabic fonts in 3 resolutions, 10
sizes, and 4 styles. Six hundred and thirty features are extracted. Fifty four features are
classical features (viz. Curvature features (Concave and convex features), Direction
features, Direction length features, Box Counting Dimension (BCD) features, Center of
gravity features, Number of vertical and horizontal extrema features, Number of black
and white components features, Smallest black component features, and Log baseline
position features). Five hundred and seventy six features are extracted using Log Gabor
features with 8 orientations and 4 scales. The accuracy computed of each feature
independently and in a combination with other features is compared. Experimental results
of applying these features on Arabic fonts are presented. The accuracy of these features
using a freely available database and our database (K AFD) compared favorably with the
state of art. To our knowledge this is the first work to use these number of fonts,
sizes,..etc.
