Automated recognition o f sign language greatly facilitates communication with deaf and
non vocal people. It is also important for the development o f human machine interface.
This thesis proposes a system for automatically recognizing Arabic Sign Language using
an instrumented glove as an interfacing device and the support vector machine algorithm
as a classification algorithm. The instrumented glove used is the PowerGlove, which is
chosen for its availability and low cost. The support vector machine algorithm is chosen
because it is a relatively new approach to machine learning and because it has many
attractive features compared to competing approaches. Promising results were obtained
using the approach presented by this thesis.
