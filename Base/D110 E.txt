Galois fields are used in innnamns applications like Recd Solomon (RS) codes, digital
signal processing (DSP) (rad cryptology. Thera is a need for efficient multiplication
and division methods that can be cushy realised on VLSI chips. Massey and Omura
have recently developed a new multiplication (dgorithm for Galois fields based on the
normal basis representation. A new bit serial modified Massey Omnra multijdier is
developed in this thesis to compute multiplications over GF{2'“) In contrast to the
existing multipliers, this new multiplier requires the 'minimum chip area. A serial in
senal ont. systolic array is presented for performing element inversion with standard
basis represented. The architecture is highly regular, modular and nearest 'neighbour
connected.
Furthenn.orc. a systolic architecture for an R S encoder, bused, on Cauchy representation
of generator matrix of the code, is presented, consisting of r + 1 cells,
where r is the redundancy of the code. This encoder is systematic, does not require
any feedback or other glolxd sigmds. Its cells are of low complexity and it. is easily
reconfigurable for variable redundancy and changes in the choice of the generator
polynomial of the code, the architecture is suitable for very high speed, applications.
Finally, a systolic array of an RS decoder, is presented. Systolic array architectures
are derived for the various steps including syndrome calculation, key equation
solution and error evaluation. The inr/riovcmcufs over existing systolic implementations
are discusst/l.
