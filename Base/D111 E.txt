The use o f Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for the design o f Application
Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) is becoming increasingly popular. This is due to
their fast turn around time, flexible architecture and their well developed design
automation tools. Compared to Mask Programmable Gate Arrays (MPGAs), FPGAs
have the advantage of field programmability requiring only few minutes to be
customized FPGAs, however, are not as dense as MPGAs due to their programming area
overhead The architectural flexibility and gate density o f FPGAs far surpasses those o f
the well known Electrically Programmable Logic devices (EPLDs).
Several technologies have been used for FPGAs customization. These include, SRAM,
anti fuse, and floating gate technolopes. In contrast to other technologies, the SRAMbased
FPGAs are volatile and hence the configuration data has to be loaded in the
device every time the system is powered up. Alternatively, anti fuses are one time
programmable lacking the necessary flexibility for design changes. A new floating gate
technology combining the SRAM and the antifuse advantages was developed The new
technology uses a new nonvolatile SRAM cell. Compared to the standard SRAM based
FPGAs, the new technology speed increase by using a charge pump which causes a
reduction o f the interconnect switch resistance. Compared to antifuse based FPGAs, the
new technology is reprogrammable and fully testable. This results in high performance
FPGA implemented circttits.. This work reports the initial development of an architecture
based on the non volatile cell. The basic lope module was designed, laid out and verified
through simulations. The interconnect architectural parameters were studied. A model
was developed to estimate such parameters.
