Effective utilization of fossil fuels for power generation depends to a great extent on the
types of fuel and the capability of the steam generating equipment to control the emissions
of air pollutants. The emitted pollutants are dispersed in the atmosphere resulting in
deterioration of ambient air, thereby posing a threat to the environment. The work in this
thesis involves estimation of the ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and suspended particulate matter due to the firing of different types of fuels
namely, Natural Gas (NG), Light Arabian Crude (LAC), and Heavy Arabian Crude
(HAC). Air pollution emissions were estimated from three stacks in the study area.
Emissions of the above air contaminants are estimated based on the application of
appropriate US EPA AP 42 emission factors and the use of the US EPA approved air
quality dispersion modeling system (CALPUFF). The predicted measurements of the air
pollutants have been compared with the current air quality standards of Presidency of
Meteorology and Environment (PME Standards) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in order
to find suitable mitigation measures to prevent any adverse effects on environment.
