This research discusses life cycle costing (LCC) and the extent of its
application in public construction projects. It studies frequency, extent and
severity of problems in application. Twenty six (26) problems were identified
and classified into five major groups.
A survey of 45 government agencies and 250 consulting firms was
concluded through a structured questionnaire. The collected data was
analyzed from the data base. The severity index and the ranking of problems
for each individual party was calculated providing the basis for the
statistical measures.
The hypothesis that the two parties generally agree on the severity of
ranking of the individual and group problems was tested. It was concluded
that the government agencies disagree with the consulting firms in the severity
ranking of problems.
The researcher concluded that most government agencies and several
consulting firms are aware of LCC technique and apply them selectively.
The frequency and extent of application is generally low, due to several
problems, namely: management pressure to meet budget and design limits,
unavailability of data resources and un familiarization of LCC benefits.
Some specialist firms, however, extensively apply the technique and are
very knowledgeable about it. The study concludes that the infrastructure
needs to be improved. Knowledgeable, competent consultants and staff are
insufficient for the needs.
