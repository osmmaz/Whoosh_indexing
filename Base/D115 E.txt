Information technology has the potential to enhance the efficiency of conducting FM
functions in any organization. The objectives of this thesis was to investigate the level
of automation of FM practices in universities world wide, followed by investigating
the level of automation and soliciting the experience of staff carrying out the range of
FM functions in the Saudi Arabian universities, and finally developing FM framework
models for the purpose of facilitating automation of FM practices in Saudi Arabian
universities. The framework models treated five major FM functions, including
construction drawing creation and management, inventory management, space
management, maintenance management, and emergency preparedness management.
To achieve these objectives, previous studies and literature was reviewed to
investigate the level of automation of FM practices in universities world wide. A
questionnaire survey was developed to assess the level of automation and solicit the
experience of staff carrying out the range of FM functions in Saudi universities. A
total of 7 questionnaires were distributed to projects & maintenance department of
Saudi Universities. A total of 7 completed responses were received. The survey was
statistically analyzed. The result indicated that great majority of the Saudi universities
use computers. However, computer resources have not been employed to utilize the
potential capabilities of IT in conducting FM functions. The survey showed a lack of
awareness among facility managers on the subject of IT utilization in the facilities
maintenance management domain. The final objective involved the development of
FM framework models based on the findings obtained from analyzing the automation
survey of FM practices in the Saudi universities.
