The chloride and sulfate content in concrete significantly influences its durability. The
concentration of these two ions is normally determined by chemical analysis. However,
these procedures are exhaustive and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need to
develop a non destructive and quick test to assess the chloride and sulfate concentration
in concrete. The laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a rapidly developing
technique, which allows the measurement of almost all elements on the surface of
solids, liquids or gases.
The objective of this study was to assess the possibility of utilizing LIBS for evaluating
the chloride and sulfate concentration in concrete. To achieve this objective, cement
paste specimens with Type I, Type V, silica fume (7 ) and fly ash (30 ) were prepared
with varying concentrations of chloride and sulfate salts. The specimens were tested
using the LIBS technique and the chloride and sulfate concentration was assessed from
a calibration curve prepared with known concentrations of these salts. The chloride and
sulfate concentration evaluated using LIBS was compared with that obtained by
Inductive Couple Plasma (ICP).
Results of this investigation indicated that the LIBS technique was very successful in
assessing the chloride and sulfate concentration in concrete.
