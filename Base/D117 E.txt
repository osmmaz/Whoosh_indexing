M ost document collaborative systems enclose implied document flow
models which are suitable only fo r their systems. Moreover, these systems can
concentrate on their forem ost objectives if they utilizes generic document flow
model. In this research, I have investigated the development o f a generic
architecture fo r Document Flow model based on WebDAV protocol (DFWDAV),
which are intended to overcome the limitations o f the specialized models.
Moreover, this model can be utilized as an infrastructure fo r document systems.
