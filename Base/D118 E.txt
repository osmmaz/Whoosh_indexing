This research work is part of an on going research project on natural
Arabic understanding at KFUPM. The project is aimed at building "A
Natural Arabic Understanding System" (NAUS). Our aim is to develop
a sentence generation module for the system.
This research work presents the design, implementation and
integration of an Arabic Sentence Generator (ASG) within NAUS. ASG
consists of four main components: preprocessor module,
morphological module, end case module, and syntactic module. The
design and implementation of this system are modular.
In the implementation, the morphological, end case, and syntactic
modules have been integrated with the correspond analysis modules
of NAUS. This, in turn, reduced development. effort and minimizes
program size. ASG has been implemented in Prolog.
