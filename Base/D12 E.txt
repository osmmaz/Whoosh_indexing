Most of Islamic and non Islamic political scholars, believe that the Islamic political
theories suffer from weakness and lack of integration. Therefore, the opinions and
hypotheses on the concept of the governance and the Islamic state differed immensely,
such as the discrepancy and the total conflict about concepts, meanings, and principles.
Moreover, the Islamic political idea rise a question wither it is to Islam as a religion and
Sharia, its compatibility with our current model i.e. the modern nation state.
Accordingly, this research will be following the comparative research approach.
The research will highlight the theories and hypotheses about Islamic governance and the
state in Islam. The impossible state book by Wael Halaq will be the main hypothesis,
which the structure of this research will be based on, and will be compared with other
ideas and thoughts; such as the classical model (al Khilafah), and the Islamic state model
which is widespread among Islamic political. In addition, this thesis will study opinions
that critique the idea of the Islamic state, as an impossible state. The research objective is
to study all the ideas, hypotheses and arguments about the Islamic state in a scientific
way, taking into consideration their contradiction.
The research concluded that the modern nation state model suffers from a moral
impasse, and the Islamic State Model, is an immature modernity idea, and is not Islamic
determinedly.
