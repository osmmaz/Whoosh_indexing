The main objective of this study was to investigate the isolation and characterization of
bacterial isolates from Aramco contaminated sandy soil site with crude oil. Two strains
were isolated and characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, these strains are
Psuedmonasxanthomonad sp. and Bacillus sp.
The removal of total petroleum hydrocarbon using consortium of the two strains was
investigated under 3 environmental factors, temperature, pH, and nutrient concentrations.
The effect of nutrients on the removal of TPH was investigated using 10mM of
Ammonium chloride, 10 mM Sodium nitrate and 10 mM Urea. Ammonium chloride show
that it is the best nitrogen source for removal of TPH by bringing down the TPH to 44.5 
followed by Urea 48  and Sodium nitrate 49.5 .
The effect of three different concentrations of ammonium chloride on the removal of TPH
was also investigated; these concentrations are 5, 10, and 20 mM. At 5 mM Ammonium
chloride, TPH was gone down to 30  followed by 10 mM (48 ) and 20 mM (77.5 ). The effect of pH (5, 7, and 9) on the removal of TPH was investigated under 5mM
ammonium chloride. At pH 7.0 the consortium of bacteria was the most efficient (TPH
down to 55 ).
The effect of temperature on the removal of TPH was also investigated. Temperatures used
25, 35, and 45 0C. The best removal efficiency of TPH was at 35 0C (TPH down to 45 ), at
25 0C the removal went down to 57  followed by 45 0C (TPH down to 72 ).
