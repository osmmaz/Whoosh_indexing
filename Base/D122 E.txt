The Lower Permian Unayzah A reservoir unit in the subsurface of eastern central Saudi
Arabia displays widespread evidence of deposition under arid to semi arid conditions,
very commonly in a wind dominated, aeolian setting. A number of distinctive aeolian
depositional facies are recognized from core and image logs including: dunes, interdunes,
sand sheet, and playa lakes. They occur with a high degree of repeatability throughout the
Unayzah A reservoirs. The study investigated the distribution of azimuthal variability in
Permian paleowind data across the Kingdom. The data were derived from image log
patterns throughout the aeolian dune facies identified in the subsurface Unayzah A
reservoir unit from within four fields selected for this study. The study involved
sedimentological description of 1160 feet of core data from six wells and analysis of
4000 feet of image log data from twenty one wells, which spanned the area from central
to eastern Saudi Arabia. A hierarchical approach was employed to investigate the
paleowind directions as follows: Paleowind azimuthal data were i) recorded appropriately
for each identifiable bed; ii) averaged over each bedset within each well; iii) averaged
over each well; iv) averaged over each field; v) and finally averaged over the four studied
fields. This rigorous approach resulted in the identification of a dominant paleowind
direction toward east northeast direction (present day), with a window ranging between
40 and 100 degrees and a mean vector of 72 degrees. Identifying the dominant paleowind
direction provides an understanding of dune distribution and shape throughout the
reservoir. It also facilitates a hydrocarbon development program that can optimize
exploitation of porosity and permeability distributions.
