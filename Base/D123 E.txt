Pure, binary and ternary equilibrium adsorption data o f methane, ethane
ethylene, nitrogen and carbon dioxide on both SR 115 and ETS 10 zeolites
are reported up to 1000 kPa pressure and a temperature range o f 280 425 K.
Ten pure models namely Toth, Unilan, Radke Prausnitz, Mathews Weber,
Volmer, Virial with two and three constants, Freundlich, Langmuir 
Freundlich, and the Loading Ratio Correlation are successfully applied to
model the pure data using unconstrained and constrained optimization
techniques. Henry's constant values and limiting heat of adsorption are
extracted from the Virial three constant model and are compared to the values
obtained from other models.
The ideal adsorbed solution theory in conjunction with the pure isotherms
of Toth, Unilan and Virial three constant is used to model the multicomponent
data. The fit of this model to these data is satisfactory except for the data of
the binary system nitrogen carbon dioxide on SR 115 zeolite. The latter poor
fit may be attributed to adsorption of carbon dioxide on the binder.
Values of the relative adsorptivity calculated from the data and the LAST
fits of the data show that the separation of methane from ethylene is feasible
on both adsorbents; but it is best on ETS 10 zeolite. Also, the separation of methane from ethane, and ethane from ethylene is feasible on ETS 10
particularly at low temperature. The separation of ethane from ethylene is not
possible on SR 115 zeolite at any conditions. However, the separation of
methane from the ternary mixture methane ethane ethylene is possible on
both types of zeolites at any conditions.
