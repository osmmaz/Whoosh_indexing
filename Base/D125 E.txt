Code division multiple access (CDMA) technology has been chosen fo r the air interface
o f the next generation (3G) wireless communication systems. However, CDMA based
systems are subject to the multiple access interference (MAI) which degrades the
performance o f the existing systems (e.g. IS 95). Among all techniques proposed to
combat MAI, multiuser detection (MUD) is the most effective one, and it has been widely
studied fo r the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, the optimum MUD detector based on
exhaustive search is extremely complex fo r practical implementations with today’s
technologies. Thus, the focus o f most o f the researches in MUD detection was to fin d
suboptimal algorithms that provide reliable performance and insure polynomial
complexity. However, there still a large gap between the performance o f the suboptimal
detectors and that o f the optimal one.
Since the MUD problem can be considered as a quadratic optimization problem with
binary or integer constraints; consequently, many advanced methods in binary quadratic programming, either heuristic or exact methods, can be applied to efficiently
approximate the optimal multiuser detector performance.
In this thesis work, new detection algorithms fo r MUD, based on heuristic algorithms,
have been developed. The memetic algorithm, the particle swarms optimization algorithm,
and the combination o f tabu search algorithm with local search algorithm were used to
develop new detection structures that fairly approximate the performances o f the optimal
MUD detector with a considerably reduced implementation/computational complexity.
Moreover, other existing heuristic based detectors are studied fo r comparison purposes.
The performances o f these detectors are compared to those o f the conventional detector,
the decorrelating detector, and the branch and bound based optimal detector.
