This study deals with quantitative detection o f factors affecting volumetric uncertainty
in Jauf reservoir in Saudi Arabia. The Devonian clastic Jauf reservoir is complex,
pinched out, highly faulted, and stratigraphic trap, limited by an erosional truncation
due to a regional Pre Unayzah Unconformity (PUU). The Jauf Formation was
developed in a tidally influenced sequence o f shallow marine to fluvial sandstones.
Latest technology for geological modeling allowed the construction of a sophisticated
model, integrating various types o f data. This complex geological model incorporates
a set of faults and an erosional unconformity surface, explicitly determined from
seismic, and facies interpreted from core and log evaluation. A special study was
conducted to explain the factors o f volumetric uncertainty. Structural uncertainties,
affecting both the unconformity and faulted blocks, were studied to explain the
volume of the reservoir. Additional sensitivity analysis was performed for facies,
porosity and gas water contact to evaluate the normalized volumetric uncertainty.
Uncertainty analysis was made to identify the number o f uncertain attributes. The
simulation models were built through the derivative tree o f ten different scenarios with hundreds of realizations using critical geological factors such as facies, porosity,
structural and fluid contacts. The study showed that, using currently available data,
the major factors affecting the uncertainty are the erosional unconformity surface
(PUU), and the facies distribution.
