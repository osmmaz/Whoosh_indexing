Software engineers are faced with new technology and left with legacy systems,
that are integral part of an organization. Legacy systems are difficult and costly to
maintain and cannot just be abandoned. They are full of problems and obstacles
that aggravate handling them. Industry and literature have been proposing
schemes to deal with legacy systems and their problems. This thesis will propose
a methodology and a tool to alleviate the problem of dealing with these notorious
legacy systems. The proposed methodology is based on similar characteristics
possessed by fragments of code scattered in source code file(s). When applied,
this methodology should help with source code understanding, which in turn
enhances legacy systems’ migration, maintenance, and parts reusability.
