In almost all over the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the hot and humid environment persists
using air conditioners from four to six months annually. And the Air Conditioner (AC)
could represent 80  of the residential electrical load. The AC compressor is switching
ON and OFF several times a day and the compressor start up causes a very high starting
inrush current associated with a voltage dip. The objective of this thesis is to study the
starting performance of the compressor induction motor and to design a soft starting
scheme in order to reduce the inrush current and consequently improving the voltage dip.
A soft starter circuit was designed to be integrated with the induction motor, which drive
the compressor. Then two different firing circuits were designed and implemented for the
soft starter. An experimental investigation was then conducted to validate the relevant
simulation results.
The analysis of the simulation and the experimental investigation show a reduction of
30  of the inrush current and 20  improvement in the voltage dip at the compressor start
up when the suggested designed model was used without compromising the starting
torque pulsation. The presented soft starter would be cost effective and could easily be
contained within the residential air conditioner unit frame.
