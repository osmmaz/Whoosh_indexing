This work describes the results of a chromatographic study of sorption equilibria and
kinetics of nitrogen and oxygen in carbon molecular sieves. The temperature dependence of
the experimental equilibrium constants and micropore dijfusivity is correlated by the Van't
Hoff and Arrhenius equations respectively.
A single column pressure swing adsorption (P S A ) unit has been designed and
constructed to study the separation of air on carbon molecular sieves ( C M S), 4A and 5A
zeolites. The effect of various operating parameters on the performance o f the unit is
reported. The results from the analysis o f PSA air separation on CM S show that a fairly
high purity nitrogen product ( > 98   ) can be easily obtained. Experimental studies of
PSA air separation on 5A zcolitc reveal that efficient separation can be achieved to yield a
oxygen product containing 4 5   residual nitrogen. In case of 4A zeoIitc using oxygen as
purge the results show that a product containing 88   oxygen can be obtained. If
nitrogen is used as purge, for the production o f nitrogen on 4A zcolite a product
concentration containing 0.8  oxygen can be achieved. It iras observed that an increase
in purge to feed ratio, L /v „ ratio and desorption time increase the product purity. On the
other hand pressure ratio and cycle time shows some optimum values for all three systems.
The theoretical model o f Farooq and Ruthven [6 9 ] h t x s used after minor modification
to predict the results for air separation on carbon molecular sieve. The model predictions
agree reasonably well with the experimental data.
