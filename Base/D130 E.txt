The purpose o f this thesis is to demonstrate an all optical reflectivity
m odulator that utilize surface piasmon resonance. The configuration
o f the structure is the well known Kretschmann configuration. It
consists o f a thin metallic layer deposited on the base of a high index
prism. A region o f saturable nonlinear medium exists under the
metallic layer. A TM polarized light (light to be modulated) is
incident into the structure from the prism side and the m odulating light
is incidence into the structure from the bottom . It was assumed that
only the modulating beam affects the nonlinear medium. Relationship
between the intensity o f the lower beam and the reflectivity was studied.
In addition, the effect o f changing the angle of incidence o f the upper
beam on the reflectivity was investigated. Furtherm ore, the effect of
increasing the saturation level on the modulation was investigated. The
applicability of the self consistent approach for TM  polarized waves was
also discussed.
