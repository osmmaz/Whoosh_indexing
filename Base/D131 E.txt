Macromolecules that possess charges as well as hydrophobes along with or pendent to
the polymer backbone are one o f the most important classes ofpolyelectrolytes, which are
often termed as ‘amphiphilic polyelectrolytes’ or ‘hydrophobically modified
polyelectrolytes ’. Recently, amphiphilic polyelectrolytes are potentially used in variety o f
commercial applications, such as associative thickeners, rheology modifiers, polymerbased
surfactants and flocculants, emulsifiers and solubilizers. In aqueous solution,
amphiphilic polyelectrolytes exhibit self assembling phenomena, analogous to
conventional surfactant micelles, driven by the balance between electrostatic repulsion
and hydrophobic interactions. Novel hydrophobically modified polyelectrolytes based on
quaternary ammonium salt and sulfur dioxide have been synthesized. Characterization o f
this novel class o f amphiphilic polyelectrolytes has been performed by (1) static (SLS) and
quasielastic (QELS) light scattering experiment, (2) Rheological properties measurement,
(3) Fluorescent spectroscopy, and (4) surface tension measurement. These techniques
emphasize the hydrophobic association (intermolecular) phenomena, flow properties,
formation o f hydrophobic microdomain and surface activity o f this novel polymer.
Currently, iron based coagulants or polymer based flocculants are preferred in water
treatment over the conventional aluminum based coagulants, which have been recently
linked to Alzheim er’s disease. In water treatment, polymer based coagulants such as
cationic polyelectrolytes are used in two distinct ways, as coagulant aids and as primary
coagulants. This study evaluates the use o f the synthesized amphiphilic polyelectrolyte as
a primary coagulant in groundwater/wastewater treatment. It is interesting observed that
appreciably low polyelectrolyte dose (0.3 ppm) is required fo r NO M removal from
contaminated water.
