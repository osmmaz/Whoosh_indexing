In this research work, the spectral response and output coupling loss of a Multilayer
Anti Resonant Reflecting Optical Waveguide (ARRO W ) are analyzed. The
multi layer A R R O W waveguide is used for enhancing the evanescent field in lowindex
media. The fraction of the fundamental TE like mode power in the low index
material is used as a measure of the evanescent field enhancement. Abo the sensitivity
of the multi layer A R R O W waveguide is analyzed. The whole analysis is
done using air as the low index superstrate. The proposed structure can be used as
an integrated mechano optical waveguide on /o ff switch. MOL with higher order approximation
has been applied to find the modal profile and propagation constants of
the eigen modes of the basic A R R O W and multi layer ARROW' waveguide. Output
coupling problems, which involves the analysis of single and double discontinuity, are
analyzed using the MOL. The Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) absorber is used to
absorb the radiated fields from these discontinuities.
