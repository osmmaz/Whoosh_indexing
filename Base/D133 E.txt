Reputation assessment is particularly needed in peer to peer systems because peers
can have conflicting interests and their autonomy is amplified by the inherent decentralization
of the environment. However, the lack of centralization makes it more
difficult to perform reputation assessment. Existing reputation systems tackle the
reputation assessment process in an ad hoc manner. In this thesis, we propose a reputation
assessment process and use it to classify the existing reputation systems. The
process consists of three main components, namely, recommendation retrieval, recommender
filtering, and recommendation evaluation. We present performance metrics
for the components in the process and conduct simulation experiments to evaluate
different techniques of reputation assessment in predicting the reputation of a target
peer while minimizing the overhead cost.
