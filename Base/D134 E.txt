The analysis and design of buried pipelines is a problem of soil structure interaction.
Compared with previous work in this area, this study utilizes a more realistic and comprehensive
non linear finite element method to analyze pipes subjected to sand overburden
and crossing highways. Soils associated with local pipe network are characterized, and
soil properties for Duncan and Selig model, which are to be used in the non linear finite
element analyses, are determined. A parametric study is carried out for pipes of various diameters
and thicknesses under sand overburden up to 60 feet and subjected to various other
loadings such as live load, internal pressure, and temperature. The results of the parametric
study are used to develop regression models using the multiple linear regression method.
The regression models are capable of predicting stresses and diameter changes in the pipes
under sand overburden and crossing highways
