The objective of this thesis is to design, analyze and implement a STATCOM based
stabilizers to enhance damping of low frequency oscillations. The effectiveness of
STATCOM gain and phase modulation channels to enhance the damping
characteristics is investigated. The coordination among the internal AC and DC
voltage controllers and the proposed damping controllers on each channel is
designed. Differential Evolution as an intelligent optimization technique is
considered to design the STATCOM supplementary damping controllers. The
implementation of STATCOM based stabilizers on Real Time Digital Simulator
(RTDS) is carried out. The RTDS experimental setup of a power system with
STATCOM is verified. The power system considered is tested through nonlinear
time domain simulations to examine the validity of the proposed approach to damp
low frequency oscillations. Comparisons with similar results reported in literature
are demonstrated.
