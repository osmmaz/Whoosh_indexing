In this thesis work, the filtering and coupling performance of an add/drop filter is analyzed. The
basic add/drop filter which has been considered in this thesis consists of two identical and
parallel single mode slab waveguides, coupled by a resonant cavity of a planar shape. A number
of planar cavity shapes were considered. This includes, for example, the rectangular, the bowtie,
the hexagonal and the parallelogram shaped cavities. The Method of Lines (MOL) using the
Layer by Layer Algorithm has been applied to model these add/drop filters.
