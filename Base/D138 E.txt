This research work is related to the modeling o f integrated optical waveguides,
waveguide discontinuities and gratings using the Method o f Lines (MoL). The basic
three point central difference approximation o f the d2/d x 2 operator used in the MoL
is extended to five point and seven point approximations with appropriate interface
conditions fo r the E and H fields. This gives us improved numerical accuracy and
reduced matrix size. It is applied to find the modal field and effective indices of the
T E and TM Modes in different multi layer optical waveguides. Single and multiple
waveguide discontinuity problems are solved using the MoL. The Perfectly Matched
Layer (PML) absorber is used to absorb the radiated fields from discontinuities. The
MoL is applied to periodic waveguide gratings and their reflection and transmission
spectra are calculated. A fast and stable Cascading and Doubling Algorithm is used
to model long gratings having thousands of periods. The MoL is applied to model
a multi layer A R R O W structure. Periodic corrugations are introduced on the top
surface of A R R O W fo r possible optical filtering applications. The reflection and
transmission spectra of the resulting A R R O W Grating are calculated fo r different
amount of loss in the A R R O W with different number of grating periods and different
groove depths.
