The aim of this research is to treat two major environmental problems in the Saudi
industrial sector in the Kingdom by chemically modifying waste fly ash to a useful
material for adsorption of Carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas stream. Adsorption is
considered as one of the potential options because of its low energy requirement, cost
advantage, and ease of applicability over a relatively wide range of temperatures and
pressures. The chemically treated fly ash was characterized using several techniques such
as EDXA, FTIR, XRD, SEM and BET in order to know the chemical composition and
physical properties of the ash. Several kinetic parameters for adsorption of CO2 were
studied to obtain the best rate of adsorption. The results revealed that the surface
morphology was quite different as a result of the chemical treatment of the fly ash
surface. The maximum adsorption capacity of the amine functionalized ash was found to
be 240 mg/g. The kinetic studies showed that adsorption capacity increases with increase
in flow rate, concentration, low humidity and temperature. Thermodynamic studies
showed that the heat of adsorption was 80 and 178 KJ/mol at low and high relative
humidity’s suggesting that the process is endothermic. The experimental data was
modeled using Langmuir, Freunlich, BET and dispersion model. It was found that BET
and dispersion models best fits the experimental data.
