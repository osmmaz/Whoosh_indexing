The Qur’anic document is a document basis for a full range of applications around the
Qur’an, such as recitation, research, taffasir, translation, etc.
The existence of different Qur’anic applications requires on the other hand the need
to standardize the computer support of the Qur’an and Qur’anic sciences. These needs
are part of a comprehensive project for the standardization of computer support giving
rise to several sub projects.
Indexing and querying Qur’anic document are part of this overall project.
The application is to implement a search engine for Qur'anic documents, full of specific
search options for Qur'anic text:
• Search by word and regular expression
• Search by different word forms
• Search by Arabic word root
• Search by synonym
• Search by subject
• Search using predefined indexes
The work required is to design and implement a search engine for the Qur'an, which
provides advanced search options.
The search engine should provide an API (Application Programming Interface) of search
that can be used by developers of Qur'an applications.
