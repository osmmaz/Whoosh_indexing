The die life data from a large aluminum extrusion ‘plant, is comprehensively analyzed,
to determine the nature of the reliability model suitable to characterize the data. It
is shown that the extrusion die life corresponding to all modes o f failures can be
modeled by Weibull reliability model. Since fm.ct.ure and wear are the two m ain
modes of die failure, they are also heated separately. A fracture mechanics based
model is proposed to predict the life of dies failed due to fracture, using M onte Carlo
Simulation. Another wear based simulation model is also developed to predict the life
of dies failed due to wear. F inally a competitive risk model is form ulated to model the
real situation when both of these major causes of failure are present simultaneously.
Comparison of the simulated results is made with the real life data collected from a
local extrusion plant (A L U P C O ). and the validity of weibull model fo r the die life
prediction is established. One of the objective of the work was to correlate the mean
and scatter of the die life (o r the scale and shape param eter o f the weibull model) with
the profile complexity of the die. Die complexity definition in literature was found to
be inadequate, and a new die complexity definition was proposed which was based on
multiple regression analysis of average die life . and key variables, and parameters
having a major influence on the die life. Thus in the absence o f any historical die
life data, the die reliability can directly be predicted using the proposed die complexity
and die life correlation. Using the results of this study it w ill be possible to calculate
the number of dies required to meet a production target (corresponding to specific
die reliability requirement), to make a comparative assessment, o f dies, as well as to
determine the age replacement strategies fo r the die.
