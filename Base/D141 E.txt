If the lightning strikes unprotected structure, a hazard in the human live
and damage to the structure's materials could occur. With the increase in the
knowledge of the lightning behavior, one of the methods to improve the
effectiveness of the classical Franklin rod is to apply a pulse voltage to the rod.
In this thesis a theoretical study using computer simulation to investigate the
effect of energizing Franklin rod on the onset condition of upward streamers is
developed for the first time. The onset condition of the upward streamers from
the rod is the condition for these streamers to materialize and become selfpropagating.
Moreover, the onset condition of the upward streamers from an energized
Franklin rod is correlated to the downward leader current and height as well as
the rod dimensions. In addition, the onset condition is also correlated to the
amplitude of the pulse voltage applied to the rod.
