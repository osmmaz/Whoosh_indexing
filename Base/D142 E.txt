The construction industry in the Kingdom o f Saudi Arabia has developed very
rapidly, and studies have indicated that by applying proper planning and systems,
every construction project could witness an increase in cost efficiency and overall
project quality. The researcher believes that constructability or buildability is the
solution, as it is based on the integration of construction knowledge and experience
during planning, design, procurement and construction phases o f a project.
Understanding the key role played by general contractors in the construction project,
the researcher developed a questionnaire as a measuring tool to assess constructability
implementation among general contractors in the Eastern Province o f Saudi Arabia.
Upon obtaining valuable data, it was found that General Contractors in the Eastern
Province have a good awareness o f constructability implementation, and this is due to
the existence o f Saudi Aramco, which insists on the constructability program as part of
its Contractor Qualification process. It was understood that constructability is being
practised commonly during the preconstruction phase by the general contractors. Also,
the implementation of constructability and other practises related to it differs
according to the project size, type and complexity.
