The Wasia aquifer outcrop section, a Middle Cretaceous elastics, from the
central Saudi Arabia had been studied by laboratory and petrographic point
counting method. Both Grain size distribution (GSD) and Pore size distribution
(PSD) data were generated from which, using various empirical equations,
petrophysical parameters were estimated. These parameters were used to assess
the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer. The results, compared with
some conventional data, show that this approach can provide a quick way of
preliminary assessing the hydrostratigraphic significance of elastics units by
serving as a viable shortcut to obtain rapid estimates of hydrogeolo'gic inputs that
aids development programs of ground water resources in such areas. In view of the
limitations of the method, further research is needed to define the standard
conditions for deriving hydrogeologic parameters from petrographic studies and a
wider sampling is required to accurately assess estimates of such parameters for
the entire Wasia clastic aquifer.
