It is recognized that strength of concrete in
structures is different than strength of control specimens,
therefore an increased demand for more precise and more
practical methods of in situ assessment of concrete quality
had led to the development of a large variety of techniques
to evaluate concrete properties, such as strength,
durability and quality control.
Pullout testing of concrete is one of these techniques
which divides into two basic categories; the first one has
an insert which is cast into the concrete (lok test), the
other has an insert fixed into a hole drilled into the
hardened concrete (capo test). The purpose of this study is to verify the accuracy and
reliability of lok test and capo test methods for estimation
of in situ compressive strength of concrete made with
commonly used local materials, and to develop the necessary
calibration curves between pullout force and standard
compressive strength for various types of aggregates, cement
contents and water cement ratios.
Based on a regression analysis of the generated data,
effects of the previous variables on the behavior of
strength have been studied and the calibration curves
developed.
The proposed models have been verified for their
reliability by comparing predicted strength with the actual
strength.
