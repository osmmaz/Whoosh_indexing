This Thesis presents the details of a study on the assessment of risks
management perception and practice of construction contractors in Saudi
Arabia toward construction risks. Focuses on risk allocation (both contractors
perception and as practiced); risk importance and risk effects on a construction
project; and compares contractors’ perception of allocating construction risks to
the common practice of allocating these risks.
To achieve the study objectives the researcher conducted a literature
review of the subject, defined important risk parameters and categories related
to construction risks, designed a questionnaire related to allocation of risks,
importance and effects of these risks on a construction projects. The
questionnaire was distributed to 82 construction contractors of grade 1 and
higher as per the classification of the Chamber of Commerce, Eastern Province
Chapter.
Responses from 30 contractors were received, analyzed, summarized
and reported. Analysis of the results indicated that the perception of
construction contractors in Saudi Arabia in allocating surveyed risks is different
from the common practice of allocating these risks. In practice, most of the
risks are allocated to contractors and none to owners. Quality of work is the
most important risk while adverse weather condition is the least important risk.
The surveyed risks have the highest impact on the schedule of a project with a
response frequency of 38.5  while the same risks affect the safety of the
project least (only with a response frequency of 8.5 ).
