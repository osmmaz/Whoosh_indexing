The Quran is di erent from all the books we know, it is the sacred book of Muslims, it
includes a massive amount of knowledge in all  elds of life, it is the reference of several
religious documents. The editing of these documents requires a very sharp veri cation and
validation of Quranic verses, since inappropriate recitation or editing are unacceptable,
any mistake could change the meaning of the Quranic verse.
To date, no software or application have been developed or even proposed in this sense,
hence its real necessity. The aim of our project is to realize a religious text editor that
provides quick search, the authenticity of information sources and transmissions security.
This project is part of a major computerisation project of the Quran within the centerIT
Research Center for the Holly Quran and its Sciences (NOOR) in Saudi Arabia.
The expected results of our solution in addition to the features o ered by the ordinary text
editors, are: adding options to the Quranic text such as quick search, text veri cation,
validation, suggestion of Quranic verses and the possibility of treating known  le formats
(Word, PDF) and implementing web services to allow other platform to use our editor
services. All this, ensuring data transmission security and the authenticity of the treated
resources.
