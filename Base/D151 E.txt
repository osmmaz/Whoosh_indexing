This study discusses the problems facing the Maintenance industry in general
and those facing the Maintenance industry and its development in Saudi
Arabia in particular.
The most important problems facing the Maintenance industry were identified
through field study visits and a literature review related to maintenance
works. There were twenty four problems found and they were grouped into
six major groups: technical problems, management and administrative
problems, financial problems, spare parts and tools problems, human related
problems, lack o f institutional and training facilities, and additional problems.
The study covered maintenance contractors in the Eastern Province (1177
Nos.) and all government sectors (70 Nos.)
The information from questionnaires was collected and analyzed statistically
using a computer. The analysis shows that there is an agreement between the
private sector and the government sector. The study shows that the most
important problems in Saudi Arabia are: financial problems, unavailability of
required spare parts and tools in the local market, unavailability of
experienced local manpower, not counting for maintenance works during the
design stage, unavailability of enough institutional training facilities and using
inferior materials during the construction phase.
The major findings were established and recommendations were made to
solve the problems or at least to reduce their effects.
