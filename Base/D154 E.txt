Associative memory neural networks are used for error correction of linear block
codes. The implementation of decoder based on neural networks does not require any
special characteristics of codes (i.e.. Linearity, cyclic nature etc.) and can decode
many different types of codes such as repetition, Hamming, BCH, R S and other
codes.The concept of Hopfield model has been applied for error correction of linear
block codes defined over GF(q) fields. All the codewords of length n are considered as
stable states which are used to construct the weight matrix as defined in the Hopfield
model. All the other possible words of length n are the unstable states. For a linear
(n.k) code, the number of stable states are '2k and the possible number of unstable
states (patterns) are 2 " 2k. The decoder would either map the unstable state to
one of the stable states or indicates that an error has occurred. The error correction
capability is the same as that of classical decoding methods, that is. only limited by
the'minimum distance constraints. Error correction is applied for the codes having
single and mxdtiple error correction capability
