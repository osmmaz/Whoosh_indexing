In this thesis we investigate asymptotic behavior of solutions of some viscoelastic
problems in bounded domains and establish some stability results for the problems.
In this regard, we establish exponential, polynomial and general decay rate results.
The decay results are established in the absence, as well as in the presence of a
source term.
