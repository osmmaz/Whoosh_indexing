This research is about investigating a new attack idea on anonymous communication
systems, in particular Tor network. Tor is an open source anonymity network that helps
users defends against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal privacy,
confidential business activities and relationships. Tor is currently the state of the art in
low latency anonymity systems and is the largest deployed anonymity network ever.
Since its first deployment in the late 2003, several vulnerabilities have been discovered
and several attacks have been reported. At the same time, the design of Tor went
through several modifications and improvements driven by the discovered
vulnerabilities and the reported attacks. This research moves in the same direction as it
investigates a relevant attack idea that would constitute a major threat to Tor clients. The
attack aims to push the client to use specific exit policies (unpopular ports) for its traffic.
This way, the path selection algorithm of Tor is manipulated to select among a small
number of Tor relays from which the attacker controls an important fraction. The attack
is successful if both the entry and exit nodes selected by the client happen to be
compromised.
