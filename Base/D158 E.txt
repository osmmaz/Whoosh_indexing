The IPv6 protocol is the next generation IP protocol that addresses many of the shortcomings in
the present IPv4 protocol. Some of the enhancements in the IPv6 over IPv4 are increased
address space, mandatory security and provision of stateless auto configuration, a technique by
which a new node forms its own address without the assistance of DHCP server or manual
configuration by a network administrator. While the stateless auto configuration approach
allows instant plugging in of a node, guarantees immediate communication with other nodes and
eliminates the costs of procuring and maintaining DHCP servers, it however opens up ways for
malicious nodes in the network to disallow many upcoming nodes from initialising their network
interfaces, a form of denial of service. In this thesis, we propose two techniques to allow
upcoming nodes in an IPv6 network to ascertain, in distributed fashion, the uniqueness of their
respective network identifiers. The first scheme uses a P2P trust verification approach for
identifying a rogue node. The second scheme is based on information hiding. Our proposed
schemes do not rely on centralized verification servers, and they prove to provide high assurance
to new nodes intending to join the network, with minimal overhead, as illustrated through our
simulations and analysis.
