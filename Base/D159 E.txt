This thesis presents the results o f research assessing the safety level in perform ing
building m aintenance w ork in Saudi Arabia. To perform this objective a survey was
distributed am ong 4 3 0 build ing m aintenance contractors in the Eastern Province o f
Saudi Arabia. In this research, the population o f contracting firm s was divided into
three categories according to the firm size (small, m edium , and large).
The survey consists o f tw o parts. The first part contains general inform ation and
this includes the total num ber o f disabling injuries, and the total w ork order hours were
used to calculate the frequency rate. The second part contains 42 safety factors relevant
to contractor safety w hich w ere used to m easure the contractors' safety attitudes. The
safety factors w ere ranked by their level o f im portance based on the survey results. It
was determined that sm all, m edium and large contractors do not agree on the ranking of
the different safety facto rs. In addition, the c o n tra c to rs' frequency rates and
contractors' safety attitudes determ inants were used to m easure the safety perform ance
level for building m aintenance contractors.
Finally, statistical correlation was used to investigate and exam ine the relationship
between the frequency rales and the safety attitudes scores for each size of contractor. It
w as concluded that a n egative slope linear relationship exists betw een the frequency
rates and safety attitudes, and large contractors have the highest correlation between the
frequency rates and contractor safety attitudes. This linear relationship could be a useful
tool in the prediction o f one variable from the other using a linear equation.
