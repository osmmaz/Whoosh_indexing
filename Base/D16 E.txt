The subject of this thesis is to study the local mapping properties of the class of
harmonic mappings given by
f ( z ) = h(z) + g(z)
where
h(z) = azn+fc_1 + 6zn a, and
g{z) = czn+fc_1 + dzn~x
where n and k are positive integers with n > 1. Here we describe and classify the
critical points of / . Then we study the behaviour of / at its different kinds of
critical points. Finally we describe a surface structure property for / .
