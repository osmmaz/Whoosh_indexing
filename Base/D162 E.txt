Diabetes is one of the most widely spread diseases in the world nowadays. It can be classified
into either Type 1, in which there is almost no insulin production, or Type 2, in which there is
insulin production but it is not enough. In order to treat this disease, the researchers are trying to
understand the system of glucose insulin system and to describe its dynamics by using several
mathematical models. Ordinary differential equations, integral differential equations, partial
differential equations , delay differential equations, and stochastic models are the five main types
of most mathematical models. In order to automate insulin delivery to diabetes patients, various
control techniques are implemented which can be classified as model  independent ( such as
optimal control )and non model independent (such as run to run control). The literature shows the
possibility of automating insulin delivery for diabetes patients. However, no method is fully
successful due to the complexity of this process, and the number and types of factors involved.
In the present study we are using a two time delay model. In terms of control, we are using linear
matrix inequality tools (LMI) in formulating the control technique which will stabilize the plant
(patient) and force it to follow the desired pattern or desired model. The new control technique is
simulated on the selected model, and the results are promising to be implementation in reality
