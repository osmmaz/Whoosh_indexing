Hardware description languages (HDLs) have been widely used for documentation,
communication and verification. They have also been used as input specification languages
to Design Automation (DA) systems which synthesize VLSI layouts. AHPL
is an HDL that has been in use for the past three decades in modeling digital systems.
Recently a language called VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)
developed under the auspices o f the United States Department o f Defense Very High
Speed Integrated Circuits Program, is rapidly emerging as the next generation Design
Automation Language. However, because of its large size and sophistication, VHDL
is a difficult language to learn and master. On the other hand, AHPL is a very concise
language that can be mastered within few hours. The objective of this research
is to develop a tool that will assist designers quickly learn and model in the VHDL
language. In this thesis, we present a tool for the automatic composition of VHDL
descriptions from their equivalent AHPL specifications. Central to the composition
algorithms is a template which is the skeleton o f a generic VHDL model consisting
of a small subset of VHDL constructs that are sufficient to capture VHDL equivalent
descriptions of any input AHPL model.
