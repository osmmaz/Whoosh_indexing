In this thesis, we address the problem of automatic processing of Arabic handwritten
checks. We proposed techniques for automatic extraction of courtesy and legal amounts
and Arabic handwritten digits and courtesy amount recognition. Real data from
CENPARMI Arabic check database is used. For automatic extraction of courtesy and
legal amount fields, we used image dilation, horizontal and vertical projections, and
image registration. We achieved extraction rates of 100  and more than 91  for
courtesy and legal amounts, respectively. More emphasis is given to Arabic handwritten
digits recognition. Novel structural features that are based on the structure of Arabic
digits are proposed for automatic recognition of Arabic (Indian) bank check digits. In
addition, a rule based classifier is implemented. Support Vector Machine (SVM),
LogitBoost, and RandomForest classifiers are used in this work. Classifiers’ fusion with
majority voting is used with and without the rule based classifier. Recognition rates of
98.95  and 99.08  are achieved using fusion of the statistical classifiers alone and with
the rule based classifier, respectively. The achieved recognition rates outperform the
published work using the same database. The experimental results indicate the
effectiveness of the structural features and the rule based classifier for recognizing
Arabic digits. The proposed technique for automatic recognition of courtesy amounts has
four main phases: preprocessing, delimiters detection, commas detection, and digits recognition. Through experimentations, the proposed technique has demonstrated
promising performance. In addition, the proposed technique can be further extended. To
the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to tackle this problem on the given
database.
