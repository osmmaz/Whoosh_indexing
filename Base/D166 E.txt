First arrival auto picking has become very important, especially with the increase of
acquired field data. Coppens (1985) proposed to use the energy ratios over receiver
or offset gathers, rather than trace amplitude in the shot gather, in order to pick the
first arrival times.
Seismic data must be subjected to preconditioning processing to minimize noise and
to stabilize the first arrival for picking. Narrow band pass filtering and amplitude
balancing are needed to precondition the seismic data.
In this thesis, I establish a new method for estimating the first arrival time. This
method outputs three values from the energy ratio curve: Max., Min., and threshold
percentage from the Max. toward the Min. The threshold percentage depends on the
noise prior to the first arrival because the slope of the energy ratio curve is affected
by the noise.
The result of manual picking shows problems in the stack caused by picking the
wrong refractors. In noisy areas, manual picking could easily mislead the processor
because of mixing the first arrival with other arrivals.
The auto picking method shows encouraging results over the tested area. The three
steps for auto picking of the first arrival are the following: converting the amplitude to
energy ratios, auto editing, and posting the picks into the shot gathers for quality
control. A Voxel geo package was used to manually pick the first arrival. Another
software package called the GLI static refraction package was also used.
