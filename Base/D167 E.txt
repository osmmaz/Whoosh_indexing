The goal o f substation maintenance scheduling is to ensure that all substation equipment
will function properly when called upon to operate or during its normal operation. All o f
the diagnostic testing and maintenance work, necessary to achieve this goal, must be
performed in as efficient manner as possible.
Two proposed methods for automatic scheduling o f outage tasks for substations system
maintenance using Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms were studied. These methods
investigated the implementation o f the proposed techniques for solving the maintenancescheduling
problem, which consist o f two combinatorial problems, work starting date and
network configuration which is found without violating the power flow constraints. These
advanced tools are a way to support maintenance schedulers and planners through
automatic scheduling to reach the optimal system reliability. The methods performances
were tested and checked through 5 Bus and IEEE 25 Bus Systems. The results showed
that these methods are reliable and practical for the maintenance scheduling problem o f
substations system.
