Currently, the billing systems for public utilities
(Electricity, Water/gas, and Telephone) are stand alone,
inaccurate, costly, and slow. Several attempts were made to
automate the billing systems. However, none of these systems
was cost effective for wide range implementation. In this
thesis, an integrated system for the three utilities and a
credit card reader li are proposed.
The proposed system has two structures. The first structure
is hardware which consists of a digital energy meter, a
digital water/gas meter, a telephone call meter, a credit
card reader, and a microcontroller. The proposed techniques
for electrical energy metering are simulated for different
sampling rate, sampling precision, and sampling delay under
harmonics and no harmonicas cases. Each meter circuit is
designed, built and tested. The second structure is software
which includes the development of system trouble shooting
program and system operation program. The integrated system
is tested and has proven to be stable, reliable and easy to
maintain within its accuracy.
