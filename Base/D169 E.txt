Designing complex digital systems from hardware description languages (HDL)
models has been in vogue in the last decade.
The task of translating an HDL description to silicon can be divided into two
stages. The first stage consists of the translation of the language model to an
intermediate logic level description (hardware compilation), and the second stage is
the translation of logic level description to VLSI layouts (physical design).
Physical design consists of tasks such as logic assignment, placement of layout
cells, global routing, and detailed routing, etc. In this work, we address the physical
design stage. Efficient algorithms were selected, modified where needed, and
implemented for the different tasks of the physical design stage.
The proposed work will enable a complete automation of VLSI layouts from
hardware description models
