This study attempts to investigate ideologically motivated interventions in news
translation. The study is based on analyzing a compiled corpus of Thomas Friedman's
articles in the London based Asharq Al Awsat Newspaper through conducting a
comparison between Thomas Friedman's articles published in New York Times and the
translation of those articles in Asharq Al Awsat. In total, 45 articles were published during
the selected time period from 1st January 2012 till 31st December 2014. To accomplish the
target of this study, researcher applies qualitative and quantitative approaches. More
specifically, a comparison was made between the source text and target text to identify
the differences through the whole corpus by counting the number of shifts: omission,
addition and modification. The study applies the Appraisal Framework developed by
Martin and White (2005) to analyze the identified shifts that indicate the possible
ideologically motivated interventions by Asharq Al Awsat Newspaper. While the applied
Model was able to analyze the most of the problematic issues, there were other shifts
that could not be classified as ideological ones through applying this framework.
The analysis of the data reveals that there were interventions in the translations of
Thomas Friedman's work in Asharq Al Awsat which might be politically and ideologically
driven. Therefore, this study will have both theoretical and practical implications and will
enhance the translation process.
