A complete design and implementation of a cell library has been accomplished in
this work. This cell library supports a formal high level synthesis framework. The
library contains the logic level models of all the primitive functions of a Realization
Specification Language (RSL). Modular design methodology is employed to support
the expandibdity of basic cells. Examples of a formal adder, multiplier, inner product
and matrix matrix multiplier are presented
