Bandwidth and power resources available in wireless networks represent scarce
resources. The ad hoc on demand routing protocols require route discovery process to
establish routes to the destination as the requirement arises. The flooding method
overloads the network with the route discovery packets, which results in many
retransmissions. This leads to inefficient utilization o f the available bandwidth. This can
be overcome by the localizing the query flood between the source and the destination. A
power efficient technique for selecting the next hop is developed.
A bandwidth efficient protocol called B GRID protocol is developed. This protocol is
based on the location aware GRID routing protocol. A GRID based route prediction
technique, which predicts the number o f hops in a route is also developed. These
protocols are also studied under channel fading and the performance parameters are
analyzed. Analysis is carried out to find the throughput o f the network under fading
channels
