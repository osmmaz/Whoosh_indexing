In this study, baseline monitoring of Organchlorine Pesticides (OCPs) and
Organophosphorus Pesticides (OPPs) were determined in four different sampling
locations comprising Tarut Bay, Jubail Coastal Area, Tarut Island and Al Oyoon
agricultural area. Samples included sea water, groundwater, sediment and Biota’s (Fish
species). Solid samples were extracted using ultrasonication assisted extraction (UAE)
and liquid samples were processed using solid phase extraction (SPE) procedures. After
extraction, analyses were performed by Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC).
The results apparently demonstrate that DDD, a metabolite of DDT is prevalent in all
samples and it has the greatest concentrations among the other pesticides. The average of
DDD in all water samples is 0.118 mg/L and the highest concentration is 0.300 mg/L.
Quantitatively and collectively, the level of OCPs in Tarut Bay was reckoned at 1.628
mg/L with the average being 0.407 mg/L. OCPs were not determined in Fresh Water
samples at both Tarut Bay and Al Oyoon. Similarly, OPPs remained undetected in Sea
Water samples. In Biota, both OCPS and OPPs were quantified, however, the level of
OCPs is orders of magnitude elevated than OPPs. Interestingly however, the levels of
OCPs detected in Biotas are within acceptable limits according to WHO provisions. The
highest concentration of OPPs in Biota was found to in Indian Mackerel and Crab, the
lowest value being visible in Shrimp. Invariably, the preponderance of these pesticides in
Tarut Bay clearly exceeds that of Jubail coastal area, and this is attributable to run off
from the agricultural activities carried out in Tarut Island.
