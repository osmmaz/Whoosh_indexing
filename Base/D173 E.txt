In many occasions, we are interested in making inference about the yet
unobserved set o f responses Yr, conditional on the observed part Ys. Using
the Bayesian approach, the probability density function for Yr, conditional
on Ys is obtained as a general procedure to derive the prediction
distributions. In this work, we find the predictive probability density
function for a set o f responses o f the Multiple Linear Regression Model
with First Order Auto Correlation and compare our results with that
available in the literature where different approaches, other than the
Bayesian approach, were used.
