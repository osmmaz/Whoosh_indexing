In 1969, Osofsky proved that a local arithmetical ring (i.e., chained ring) with zero
divisors has infinite weak global dimension [28]. In view of [19, Corollary 4.2.6], this
result asserts that the weak global dimension of an arithmetical ring is 0, 1, or ¥. In 2007,
Bazzoni and Glaz studied the homological aspects of Pr¨ufer like rings, with a focus on
Gaussian rings. They proved that Osofsky’s aforementioned result is valid in the context of
coherent Gaussian rings (resp., coherent Pr¨ufer rings) [20, Theorem 3.3] (resp., [5, Theorem
6.1]). They closed their paper with a conjecture sustaining that “the weak global dimension
of a Gaussian ring is 0, 1, or ¥” [5]. Recall for convenience that the class of Gaussian rings
contains strictly the class of arithmetical rings.
Since 2007, the Bazzoni Glaz Conjecture is still elusively open and several papers have
appeared in the literature featuring partial results, of which some are of relevant significance.
This MS thesis plans to track and study all these works dealing with this conjecture
from the very origin; that is, 1969 Osofsky’s proof of the existence of a module with infinite
projective dimension on a local arithmetical ring. Precisely, we will examine all main results
published in [1, 3, 5, 12, 20, 28] which tested the validity of the conjecture in subclasses
within the class of Gaussian rings or provided large families of commutative rings (emanating
from special constructions) sustaining the conjecture. We will also examine Couchot’s
very recent contribution to the problem via the finitistic weak dimension. Our ultimate goal
is to identify new methods and techniques to tackle these problems from different angles
which might offer a possible “happy end” to this conjecture and related problems in the
future.
