The behavior of laterally loaded pile groups can be studied easily in the laboratory on
small scale model, saving a lot o f expenses, efforts and time. This research presents
investigations on small scale closely spaced pile groups embedded in sandy soil in order
to understand the behavior o f such model when subjected to lateral load. The
experimental program consisted o f studying the behavior of twelve models by varying the
following parameters: number o f piles, loading conditions (static or cyclic) and sand
saturation conditions (dry or submerged). The static and cyclic loading were achieved by
means of specially designed loading actuator. The cyclic loading represents the wave
action exerted on offshore structures. Experimental bending moment and deflection along
the pile length were compared with semi empirical ones. The behavior o f the small scale
model was compared to full scale model which shows reasonable results. Experimental
results have shown that the behavior o f pile groups was greatly influenced by the study
parameters. Finally, the small scale model in laboratory can be used to study the behavior
of laterally loaded closely spaced pile groups.
