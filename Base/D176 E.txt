In this study, the behavior of transmitted waves (electromagnetic and quantum) is
studied in gain (amplifying) media using complex media characteristics representation.
The time independent and time dependent wave equations (electromagnetic and
Schrodinger), that show contradictory results for the behavior o f transmitted waves in
gain media, are used to study the transmission comparatively. The contradiction between
the results of the time independent and time dependent wave equations is studied and
correlated to the resonance poles of the reflectance and transmittance. A first successful
explanation for the paradoxical results of the time independent and time dependent wave
equations is presented in this study.
