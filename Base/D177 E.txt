In this thesis, we have benchmarked maintenance practices and processes in
Procter and Gamble plants in the region. This research has answered the question of how to
improve maintenance practices and processes in a targeted plant via benchmarking. The
thesis objectives have been achieved by benchmarking key maintenance factors,
determined via using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, out of standard
maintenance factors that are available across the literature.
The study outcomes have focused on the results and improvements of an identified key
maintenance factors, across benchmarked plants. This study also identifies key maintenance
factors that need to be the focus of any effort, in order to improve the performance of the
maintenance system. We have concluded this research by identifying best plants, documenting key maintenance
practices and processes and recommending key actions for each key maintenance factor, in
order to improve maintenance systems.
This thesis has utilized benchmarking to come up with a set of recommendations to improve
maintenance performance at the selected plant. Main recommendations were focusing on
achieving best maintenance output measures through applying strong daily management
system for planned maintenance, focus on productivity trainings as well as apply effective
work process standards and incentive systems that were successfully applied in other
benchmarked plants.
