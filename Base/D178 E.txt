Software watermarking is one of the most important methods for protecting copyrights
and authenticating ownership; and hence preventing software piracy. It received more
attention recently and it is expected to even get more interest. However, in all the work
done in this area, none o f them have used a specific or a particular evaluation measures to
criticize the proposed software watermarking technique.
In this thesis, several issues related to software watermarking were studied and a survey
was conducted on the current and promising new techniques designed to reliably preserve
and protect software programs. Different software watermarking techniques and attacks
to those techniques were classified and evaluated. A promising benchmarking framework
for software watermarking techniques was proposed, based on the results o f conducted
experimentations, which allows for measuring the efficiency o f current and possibly
future proposed software watermarking schemes. This will allow comparing different
watermarking techniques and will lead to speeding up the potential research work in this
area.
