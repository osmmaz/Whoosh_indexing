A blind equalization algorithm with a variable step size procedure leading to faster
convergence speed is considered. An earlier work on an enhanced version of the Decision
Directed Modified Constant Modulus Algorithm(DD MCMA), used with a variable
step size procedure showed a very good convergence speed (compared to the same
algorithm with a fixed step size) on different types of channels and different kinds of
modulation schemes. Different step size update schemes were considered, a prediction
error dependant scheme were adapted to change the step size according to the autocorrelation
of the prediction error. The step size parameters were optimized using
particle swarm optimization method which yield solutions that gave good results in
terms of the step size affect on the speed of convergence.
