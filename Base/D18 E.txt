Since the appearance of the climate change crisis, modern man has begun to perceive religions
from a new stand point, an ecological outlook in which everything is connected to everything
else and nature is seen as an organic unity. It is this type of reasoning that has motivated
members of all faiths to study and reevaluate their religious traditions.
This thesis, thus, intends to frame an enlightened Islamic discourse to address global
environmental issues. The notions of environmental preservation from the Islamic perspective
will be presented. It will also discuss the spiritual values and teachings of Islam which are highly
recognized and, therefore, be used in attaining a sustainable model and development of natural
resources and biodiversity.
