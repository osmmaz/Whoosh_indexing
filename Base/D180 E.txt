T he e ffect of organic loading ra te s and the solids re sidence
time (SR T ) on th e aerobic treatm ent of phenol and o cresol
bearing w astew ater by sequencing b atch reacto rs (SBRs) was
investig ated . SBRs w ere utilized to tre a t phenol an d o cresol,
aerobically a t a h ydraulic retention time (HRT) of one day and
varying SR T s. The re a cto rs achieved over 99.5  removal of phenol
and o creso l a t toxicant loading in th e ranges of 100 800 kg
phenol/m 3 d a y and 100 600 kg cresol/m 3 day a t SRTs of 10 days
and above w ith the efflu en t BOD and TSS concentrations consisten
tly about 5 and 12 mg/1, respectively. However, a rapid
b reak th ro u g h re su ltin g in only 65  removal efficiency of phenolics
a t loads of 800 kg phenol/m 3 day and 600 kg cresol/m 3 day
occurred a t 3 and 5 day for phenol, and o cresol, respectively,
sim ultaneously with a b reakth rough of total stispended solids
(T SS). T he rap id deterioration in effluent quality ensued toxicant
loadings of 0 .7 mg phenol/m g MLVSS and 0 .8 mg cresol/m g MLVSS.
B etter than 94  phenol removal efficiency was achievable at the
5 day SRT biotreatm ent.
