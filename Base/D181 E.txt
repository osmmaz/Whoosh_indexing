The lithostratigraphic relationship between the Jubaila and Arab Formations is not
fully understood and is often misinterpreted in the subsurface. Since the type section of
the Jubaila is in the outcrop and that of the Arab is subsurface, there is no common
feature to easily define the contact in subsurface. The highly productive Arab D reservoir
spans the Jubaila and Arab Formations. One reservoir layer in Ghawar field (at the top of
reservoir zone 2B) is considered in previous studies to possibly equate with the Jubaila 
Arab formational boundary, and it is confirmed in this study.
Semi quantitative micropalaeontological analysis of thin sections from three
localities in surface exposures o f the Jubaila and lower Arab Formations in Riyadh area
enables recognition o f this boundary in eight wells in eight fields in the east of Saudi
Arabia.
In this study, the biofacies have been divided into nine biofacies that characterize
the Jubaila and Arab Formations and the nature of the Jubaila Arab formational contact.
Calibration of the wireline logs with these biofacies will assist in the recognition of this
event in uncored wells, and assist in regional Arab D reservoir layering. Such
information will also contribute to improve the understanding of intra Arab D reservoir
sequence stratigraphy, palaeoenvironmental and sedimentological variations and
unexpected production behavior of the reservoir.
