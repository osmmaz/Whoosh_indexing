This thesis describes the development of methods for the preparation of chiral racemic
substituted cyclic and a cyclic nitrones. This has been accomplished by the following
points.
In chapter 3, the diastereoselectivity in the cycloaddition reactions of several monoand
disubstituted alkenes with a ( )norephedrine derived methylenenitrone has been
investigated. The stereochemical analysis of the addition products (i.e. isoxazolidines)
has been carried out by X ray, NMR and chemical conversions. The NMR spectra of the
isoxazolidines at low temperatures indicated the presence of either a single or a
predominant invertomer. The stereochemistry of the invertomers and nitrogen inversion
barriers are determined using complete line shape analysis and their dependence on
solvent is discussed.
In chapter 4, a study of the stereo  and face selectivity of the cycloaddition
reactions of several mono  and disubstituted alkenes with 4 hydroxymethyl 3,4,5,6 
tetrahydropyridine 1 oxide has been carried out. The addition reactions have displayed a
very high degree of face selectivity (13 48:1). Use of dimethyl methylenemalonate as a
protective group in nitrone cycloaddition reactions has been demonstrated. The
invertomeric analysis revealed that the bicyclic cycloadducts remain predominantly as the
cis fused isomer which leads to the formation of synthetically important secondgeneration
cyclic aldonitrones via peracid oxidation. One interesting finding was that
treatment of the cycloadducts with two equivalents of peracid afforded the cyclic Nhydroxy
lactams, presumably via further oxidation of the aldonitrones. The piperidine
ring has been elaborated by cycloaddition reaction of the second generation nitrones with
several alkenes, which in most cases gave the cycloadducts in a stereoselective manner.
