Fusion bonded epoxy coated steel reinforcement is used to enhance the corrosion
resistance of concrete structures. However, the effectiveness of epoxy coating
may be compromised due to inadvertent presence of holidays and surface
damage. Additionally, the bond strength of epoxy coated rebars is expected to be
less effective than that of uncoated bars and may be farther impaired due to
prolonged exposure to thermal variations. This research was designed to evaluate
the bond strength between FBEC bars and concrete under heat cool cycling
exposure. The influence of holidays and coating damage on corrosion resistance
of FBEC bars was also investigated.
Results of this research indicated a reduction in the critical bond strength between
steel and concrete due to the use of epoxy coating. The potential measurements
demonstrated the need for an appropriate interpretation of results when this
technique is used. The corrosion current density measurements indicated no
corrosion of FBEC bars.
