The theme in this work is to find a stable control for heat spread equations
When the propagation coefficient is dependent on time and distance using a transform
Linear differential.
This method is based on finding linear differential conversion that can be reversed and converted
The original system via a stable system previously installed.
In the latter examples simple examples have been shown to take advantage of this method.
