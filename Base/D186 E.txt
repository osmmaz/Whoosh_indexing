The object in this work is to .nd a stabilizing boundary control for a class of
nonlinear parabolic PDE system by using a transformation (transmutation operator).
We transform the original system into a new one whose stability has been proved. We
shall work out a few examples to illustrate the boundary control of system exhibiting
blow up in .nite time, thus showing the e¤ectiveness of the method.
