The aim of this action is to adjust the constant control of the class from
Parallel non linear PDE system using conversion (transformer engine).
We convert the original system to a new system that has proven stable. we
Some examples should be made to illustrate the control of the display system boundaries
Blowing in time, thus showing how effective the method.
