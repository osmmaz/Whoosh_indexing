Boundary element solutions for the bending o f non prismatic beams and plates are
presented. The boundary integral formulation is developed for the analysis of nonprismatic
beams. The required fundamental solutions for non prismatic beams of linear
and parabolic profiles are derived and exact relations are obtained among the variables
over the nodes (beam supports). The method is then extended for the analysis of
continuous beams with varying depth. The problem of a plate with linearly varying
rigidity is solved by splitting the equation governing the transverse deflection of the plate
into two Poisson's equations, for which, fundamental solutions are available. Finally, the
proposed formulations for both beams and plates are tested through several numerical
examples.
