Experimental research has been conducted on an inter bracedcolumn
System .to investigate that the load carrying capacity
of a series of straight columns would be increased effectively
by bracing them with very light braces. It is difficult
to predict reliably the strength of any column by theoretical
methods, where the strength of an actual steel column is
impaired by the presence of residual stresses and initial
imperfections (crookedness). In addition, however, very
limited theoretical study without experimental investigation
has been carried out. Therefore, the experimental work is
needed to provide satisfactory evidence of the predicted buckling
loads of an interbraced column system and the corresponding
brace forces.
The results of the study indicate that very large gains
in the column carrying capacity can be achieved by using a
light bracing system of small strength and rigidity. Also
these results agreed to large extent with the theoretical
studies.
