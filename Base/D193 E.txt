Memories, being an important part of most digital systems, should be properly tested. The
testing time of these memories is a major concern since its cost constitutes a large
percentage of the total cost. Histogrammer memory chips (HRAMs) are commonly used
in digital image processing and also widely used for on line sorting of data in nuclear
physics experiments and in medical imaging systems.
This research investigates the testability problem of a histogrammer memory chip
(HRAM) being designed at KFUPM. A general fault model for the HRAM is adopted and
new design for testability features are identified. Efficient O(Vn) test procedures for both
the memory array and decoders of the HRAM are described (n is the number of memory
cells). The testability features area overhead is only 0(log n) as compared to 0(V «) for
previous approaches. Random Built In Self Test (BIST) implementation of the array and
decoder test algorithms is described in detail.
