A num erical study o f flow in a Periodically Converging Diverging Channel is •perform
ed to exam ine turbulent separated flow and heat transfer characteristics. This
geometry has num erous applications in high performance heat exchanging systems
because o f its effective influence on heat transfer augmentation. The method is based
on the fu lly conserved control volume representation o f fu lly elliptic Navier Stokes,
and Energy equations in body fitted orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system . Turbulence
is sim ulated via two equation (k — s ) model.
The presented results consist o f computed velocity and streamline distributions,
the kinetic energy o f turbulence, pressure drop, friction factor, and local, average and
m axim um N usselt num ber distribution. System atic variations are made in Reynolds
num ber (40.000 to 100,000) and the aspect, ratio ('2a/X=0.27 and 0.34). The study
is fu rth er extended to flows with different ranges o f inlet swirl. The results are
compared with the different available experimental data and show that the method
with the utilized turbulence closure model and the discretization scheme reproduce
the essential features o f various channel heat transfer and flu id flow effects observed
in experiments.
