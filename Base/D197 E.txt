The present work aims at the study of the buoyancy effects on entropy generation
due to laminar mixed convection in vertical channels of different geometries. The
geometries considered are namely: vertical channels between parallel plates, vertical
circular tubes and vertical concentric annulus. Attention is devoted to investigating the
optimization of the flow and heat transfer in such channels under the mixed convection
condition via the minimization of the entropy generation. In this regard, the optimum
values of the buoyancy parameter (Gr/Re)optjmum at which the entropy generation assumes
its minimum have been obtained and presented for both fully developed and developing
laminar mixed convection flow. Moreover, the effect of other operating parameters of
relevant importance is also discussed and presented.
