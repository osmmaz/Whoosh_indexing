A Numerical study is performed examining turbulent separated flow and heat transfer
characteristics in axisymmetric expanding ducts, with emphasis to the annular
diffuser geometry. The method is based on the fully conserved control volume representation
of fully elliptic Navier Stokes and Energy equations in body fitted orthogonal
curvilinear coordinate system. Turbulence is simulated via the two equation (k t)
model.
The presented results consist of computed velocity and streamline distributions,
the kinetic energy of turbulence, and local and average Nusselt number distributions.
Systematic variations are made in the Reynolds number (6x l(P 6x 1(f) and the
outer wall half angles (T 2(f, 9(f). The study was further extended to flows with
a range (0.0 0.9) of inlet swirl. Comparison with available experimental data shows
that the method with the utilized turbulence closure model and the discretization
scheme reproduces the essential features of various diffuser heat transfer and fluid
flow effects observed in the experiments.
