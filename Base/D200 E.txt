Simulation modeling is an increasingly popular and effective tool for analyzing
transportation problems with the least cost. Recent advancements in computer technology
have led to the development of high fidelity microscopic simulation models. For any
simulation study, model calibration is a crucial step for obtaining any representative
results from the analysis.
The main objective of this study is to calibrate and validate the microscopic traffic
simulation model VISSIM to the traffic conditions of Khobar and Dammam, Saudi
Arabia. VISSIM is a German microscopic simulation model that is beginning to see
increased use within the United States and in many other major countries. It is one of the
few comprehensive microscopic traffic simulators covering a wide range of traffic
situations including traffic and transit on urban roads and motorways.
To achieve this main objective several default values for the parameters such as
number of observed vehicles, additive and multiplicative part of desired safety distance,
amber signal decision and distance required in changing lane were modified to replicate
field conditions. The results with these modified values showed no discrepancy between
the model simulation MOE’s and the field observed MOE’s.
In order to validate the calibrated model, it has been applied on another network
chosen in Dammam city using a different data set. Model validation was regarded as a
final stage to investigate if each component adequately reproduces observed travel
characteristics and overall performance of the model is within an acceptable error. The
results of the validation showed that the difference between the field observed MOE’s and
the VISSIM simulation results are within the acceptable range.
