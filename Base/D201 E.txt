Genetic algorithms have been applied fo r null steering to control grating lobes in
scanned arrays. Element position perturbations and complex weight variations are
the two techniques used for null steering. The use of genetic algorithm for null
steering provides grating lobe control at the specified directions. Further control of
the grating lobe has been achieved by the appropriate choice of the element pattern
of finite length dipoles. Results presented for both uniform and non uniform arrays,
using the GA based control as well as control based on element pattern synthesis
show that when these techniques are combined, good radiation patterns are obtained.
This research has also shown that by controlling grating lobes, the directivity and
the useful scanning range of the array increases. Null steering to control grating
lobes does not affect the main beam. It is thus concluded from this research that the
genetic algorithm can be an effective tool for designing scanned arrays with controlled
grating lobes.
