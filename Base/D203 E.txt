The interaction o f antiarthritic drug aurothiom alate (Autm)n with thiourea,
selenourea, imidazoildine 2 selone, SCN* and SeCN* in aqueous solution has been studied
using l3C NMR spectroscopy. It has been observed that the thiourea forms a 1:1 complex
with (Autm)n, SCN ' causes an increase in the polym erization o f (A utm )n, while,
selenourea, imidazolidine 2 seIone and SeCN' cause redox reactions with (Autm)n to form
metallic gold, metallic selenium and thiomalic disulfide.
The characterization of polymeric gold(I)captopril (Aucap)n has been carried out
using viscosity and electronic, mass, 13C and ^ N NMR spectroscopies. It was observed
that the degree o f polymerization in (Aucap)n is much higher than that o f (Autm)n. Mass
spectroscopy has shown two characteristic routes o f fragmentation. It has been observed
that (Aucap)n also forms 1:1 complex with thiourea, while it undergo a redox reaction with
selenourea and SeCN' to produce metallic gold, metallic selenium and captopril disulfide.
The ligand scrambling reaction of R3 PA u13C 15N complexes to form [(R3 P)2 Au]+
and [Au(13C l5N)2 ]' species has been studied using 13C, 15N and 31P NMR spectroscopy
in a series of complexes. We have reported U ^ lp .n c ), 2J(31p_13q and 3J(31p.
15n) coupling constants in these complexes and have observed various trends in them with
respect to basicity of phosphine ligands. The free energy o f activation in these complexes is
also measured using 3 !p NMR band shape analysis.
The antisymbiotic trans effect in a series o f R3 PA uS13C 15N complexes has been
studied using infrared, I3C, I5N and 3IP NMR spectroscopies. It has been observed that
unlike R3 PA ul3C 15N complexes, the R3 PA uS13C 15N complexes do not undergo ligand
scrambling reactions.
