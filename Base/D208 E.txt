Low molecular weight poly(acrylates and methacrylates) are extensively used as macromonomers
in the syntheses o f block and graft copolymers, and in the formulation o f “high solids” paints and
coatings. Molecular weight control is commonly achieved by using thiols. However, thiols impart
undesirable properties such as color, odor and toxicity to the finished products. More recently, the
use of cobalt (II) oximes has proved to be efficient in achieving molecular weight control. This
new class o f compounds works at parts per million levels. It also eliminates the problems
encountered with conventional molecular weight regulators. This study involved the synthesis and
characterization o f cobalt alphafurildioxime {Co(ct fdo 2H)2(BF2)2.2H2 0 }, and its use as a
potential catalytic chain transfer agent (CCTA) in the bulk free radical homo  and copolymerization
of some methacrylates and styrene monomers. Azobis(isobutyronitile), AH3N was
used as initiator. Elemental analysis and UV visible technique were used to characterize the
CCTA. Molecular weight o f the resulting polymers was studied by dilute solution viscometry
(DSV) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Catalytic chain transfer constant (Cs) values
were evaluated using the Mayo equation. The effects o f the chain transfer agent on polydispersity
index (PDI) and monomer conversion were also investigated. Molecular weights obtained from
both DSV and GPC and were found to decrease with increasing concentration o f the CCTA. Cs
values evaluated were comparable in magnitude to those reported in the literature. The samples
had a relatively narrow polydispersity in the range o f 1.5 to 2.0. Monomer conversion was found
to decrease with increasing concentration o f the CCTA. This has been attributed to retardation in
rate of certain processes.
