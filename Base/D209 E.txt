Reinforced concrete is per se neither elastic nor plastic material. lt exhibits
damage attributable to irreversible changes; i.e. slip and micmeracking. Three
phases of behavior exist and interact: elasticity, plasticity and damage. An
extensive literature review is carried out to figure nut the phenomenological
aspects of damage along with the existing constitutive models.
