This thesis presents the efforts of comparative religion scholars in the
classification of religions, some of the selected models from the traditional
scholars: Ibn Hazm Al Andalusi and Al Shahrestani; and of the contemporary
scholars: Mohammed Kamal Ja’far, and Mohammed Khalifah Hasan.
This thesis demonstrates that classification of religions has a high status
for Muslim scholars, traditional and contemporary alike. That is due to the fact
that classifying means distributing and compiling similar ideas in accordance to
specific standards, which enhances the understanding of the classified groups.
This study reflects also the diversity in classification used by the writers,
and demonstrates their knowledge in various classes that may have not been
used.
It was found that contemporary scholars have learnt from their
predecessors. However, their classifications were not more comprehensive than
the predecessors’. It was noted that the most comprehensive classifications are
the ones which were based upon induction; such as the classification of Ibn
Hazm Al Andalusi and Mohammed Khalifah Hasan.
The concepts of monotheism and prophecy were among the key
standards which the four scholars agreed upon and have not omitted them in
their classifications, making it resemble the common essence among them.
Finally, all the classifications studied in this thesis are widely used and
applied in contemporary history of religions.
