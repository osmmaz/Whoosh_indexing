In this thesis report, I investigate the Ce/W oxidesordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)
support modification effect on PtPd based electrocatalyststowards formic acid oxidation
reaction (FAOR). Oxides modified ordered mesoporous carbon (Oxide OMC) support
was prepared by hard template method. While PtPd bimetallic catalysts were synthesized
using borohydride reduction method with different ratio of Pt and Pd metals.
Physical properties of CeO2/WO3 OMC supports and catalyst samples were characterized
by TEM, XRD, SEM, EDX, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and TGA. Both SEM&
XRD analysis shows that modified support based PtPd catalysts exhibit uniform metal
dispersion and increasing Pt to Pd ratio enhances crystal size reduction of metals.
Whereas, Pt and Pd particle size reduction also verifies by TEM analysis.Surface
properties of prepared catalyst samples were analyzed by BET and BJH pore size
analysis. BET explains the higher surface area and smaller pore diameter for support
modified samples. TGA analysis showed the support stability and oxidation temperature
around 420 470°C.
Electrochemical analysis such as CV, CA, CO stripping voltammograms and H2
adsorption/desorption analysis were employed to evaluate the electro oxidation activity of
electrocatalysts. CV results confirmed that modified support CeO2 OMC and WO3 
OMCbased Pd catalyst exhibited much higher anodic oxidation current activity and
stability than that of unmodified supported electrocatalysts.
