Victims of road traffic accidents and the resulting casualties are continuously increasing. In
Saudi Arabia, traffic accidents are among the major causes of death, particularly for the female
travelers group. The local custom and religion abide females to drive for their work trips. They
therefore depend on drivers (their spouse or any other male driver) to reach their work. Many of
them travel long distances for their work trips. This research attempts to find the potential factors
which are involved in the accident creation. Data was collected all over the kingdom of Saudi
Arabia from schools and colleges. The possible causes studied include: the driver, female traveling
attributes, vehicle characteristics, and the environment. The research includes the results, showing
the order of significance of the accident causing factors interactions along with a detailed
interpretation and discussion of the data. Further it was noted that there is an urgent need for
improvement of safety standards in different provinces of the kingdom.
