The objectives of this thesis were, 1)  to investigate and evaluate the challenges that
influence the successful implementation of building management system (BMS) during
the design, installation and operation and maintenance stages of projects, 2)  to utilize the
methodology of the Group Analytic Hierarchy Process (G AHP) model for developing a
conceptual model for prioritizing the influential challenges that impact the successful
implementation of BMS, 3)  to carry out case studies to validate the problems that face
achieving full potential of BMS, and 4)  to develop a plan of action to facilitate the
identified challenges. Thirty two challenges which influence the process of implementing
the BMS were identified. These challenges were evaluated through distributing a five
likert questionnaire survey to A/E, construction firms and facility managers form the
Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. (G AHP) model was utilized to prioritize the identified
32 challenges through reflecting the opinion of six experts in BMS. Eight case studies in
the Eastern Province were conducted to validate the developed model. Finally, literature
review and interviews were carried out to develop a proposed plan of actions to facilitate
the identified challenges. This study has the potential to increase awareness among
buildings owners and people in the building industry in Saudi Arabia about the
challenges that influence the successful implementation of the BMS during the life cycle
of office building projects.
