This thesis presents results o f a study on causes, effects and controls of change orders
in large building construction in Saudi Arabia. To achieve the study objective, the researcher
carried a literature review of the subject covering periodicals, dissertations, previous research
studies and books written on the subject of change orders. In light o f the literature study the
researcher developed a survey questionnaire.
The questionnaire was distributed to all building contractors, grade 1 and 2 registered
with the Eastern Province Chamber o f Commerce as well as building consultants. The survey
questionnaire included four areas o f study. The first included questions on the general market
characteristics and general trends. The second included questions on the possible causes of
change orders. The third included questions on the possible outcomes o f changes. The fourth
included questions on the management control tools utilized for minimizing the problems of
change orders.
Responses from 34 consultants and contractors working in the field of large building
construction were analyzed. Analysis of data indicated that cost overruns due to change orders
were in the magnitude o f 6 to 10  o f the original contract value. Schedule overrun was
reported less than 10  o f the original contract duration. The study also concluded that the
owner is the major source o f changes and that most changes are architectural. Change of
plans, and material substitution are first causes o f change orders in large buildings.
The study also concluded that responses from contractors and consultants agree about
the causes, effects and controls o f change orders and recommended to include the owner in
future studies to verify the reasons behind changes made by the owners.
