The characterization of channels having randoaly tiae
varying response is inportant for systea perforaance analysis
and design. In particular, such characterization is needed
for the perforaance evaluation over aany radio fading
channels. Those channels exhibit a aultipath nature of signal
propagation causing destructive or constructive interference
to the signal which leads at sone instances to the loss of
the signal completely.
The sain objective of this thesis is to find a suitable
statistical aodel of soae radio channels in the Southern
Region of Saudi Arabia, fihen incorporated into the systea
design, these aodels should help in iaproving the perforaance
of the systea. The appropriate statistical aodels, the fade
depth statistics, and the fading characteristics are found
for soae links in the region. Moreover, discussions regarding
the physical interpretation of these results are presented.
