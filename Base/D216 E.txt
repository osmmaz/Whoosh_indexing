With the rapid growth of digital communication in recent years, the need for high of channel estimation in wireless OFDM systems, which tracks the multipath fading
channel by using the LMS algorithm. OFDM systems are highly sensitive to
frequency offsets, and one main reason for drifts in carrier frequencies is channel
phase. We will also propose an adaptive scheme for channel phase compensation.
speed data transmission is increased. Moreover, future wireless systems are expected
to support a wide range of services which includes video, data and voice. OFDM
is a promising candidate for achieving high data rates in mobile environment, due
to its resistance to ISI, which is a common problem, found in high speed data communication.
In OFDM, modulation may be differential or coherent. When using
differential modulation there is no need for a channel estimate but its performance
is inferior than the coherent system. Coherent modulation requires the channel estimation
which gives better performance but with relatively more complex receiver
structure. Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation is used to achieve reliable channel estimates
by transmitting pilots along with data symbols. In this thesis, we will analyze
different pilot patterns in terms of BER and propose a new scheme for transmitting
pilot symbols in wireless OFDM systems. We will also propose an adaptive scheme
