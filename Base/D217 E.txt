Road traffic accidents (RTAs) have become an internationally recognized concern
as they have become a worldwide cause of deaths. Young drivers or novice drivers are
overrepresented in road traffic accidents and injury fatality statistics throughout the
world. Traffic accidents have become a worrying issue in Saudi Arabia, where traffic
accidents threaten the health and the lives of its citizens, its economy, security and
productivity. This study tackles the characteristics of young drivers involved in road
accidents and traffic violations in the Dammam Metropolitan Area in the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia (KSA). Moreover, the study addresses young men’s driving for fun, such as
driving over sand dunes, illegal drifting and wheeling and car video games. Big Five
Inventory psychology test is used to identify the personality of young drivers involved in
accidents and traffic violations. The results show that, there is a relationship between the
young drivers and the personality of drivers. Also, it was found that, driving for fun, such
as driving over sand dunes and drifting and wheeling represents high risk factors of
young drivers' involvement in traffic accidents and violations. The research results lead to
a better understanding of young drivers involved in road accidents, and suggest
recommendations to reduce road accidents among young drivers.
