Expansive clay soil was encountered in different areas of
Saudi Arabia. This study presents the locations of this type of
soil in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and its characteristics.
The study showed that Al Qatif and the villages around it,
as well as Al Hofuf and the villages around it are rich in expansive
soils. Climate and geology of the area have a big influence
on the formation and behavior of expansive soils. Clays in Al 
Qatif area are highly plastic, p ossess very high swelling potential
and rich in smectite, illite, dolomite and palygorskite. Al Hasa
clays are plastic, possess moderate to high swelling potential and
rich in calcite, illite, paly gorskite and kaolinite. A strong correlation
between swelling potential and the plasticity of the clay was
found and an empirical equation was developed to present this correlation.
Finally, the study showed that an increase in surcharge
load decreases the magnitude of percentage of swell while the
swelling pressure remains almost constant.
