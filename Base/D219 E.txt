The use o f antenna arrays is one o f the promising schemes for reducing
the effect o f multiple access interference in 3G systems. So, it is expected that
the use o f 2 D RAKE receivers will improve capacity, coverage, and quality
in W CDMA systems. However, the performance o f 2 D RAKE receivers is
sensitive to the spatial correlations at the antenna array elements. The goal
o f this thesis is to introduce the appropriate spatial models o f both typical
urban and bad urban channels, calculate the resulting spatial correlations
and then analyze the performance o f 2 D RAKE receivers in bad urban
microcellular channels. Geometrically based modeling is used to derive the
angle o f arrival statistics and then the temporal and spatial correlations at
the BS are calculated using numerical integration schemes. The results show
the differences in the spatial and temporal characteristics between TU and
BU areas for both LOS and N LOS cases. The performance o f 2 D RAKE
receivers in spatially correlated Nakagami faded bad urban channels is
investigated by deriving the theoretical BER and running Monte Carlo
simulations. The results show the significant gain in capacity o f 2 D RAKE
receivers as compared to 1 D RAKE receivers and the effect o f the existence
o f the LOS component on the spatial diversity gain as compared to N LOS
case.
