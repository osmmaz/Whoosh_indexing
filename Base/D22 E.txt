This research discusses subtitles as a means for making Bedouin oral history accessible
to Arab audiences. Bedouin oral history is under researched in academia, in general, and
efforts should be invested to preserve it. The Bedouin oral history reflects much about
the Bedouin life style, habits, values and tradition. Thus, making it accessible to all Arabs
will help preserve the Bedouin culture for future generations. For this reason, the
Bedouin traditional story under study, titled Al Mahdi, was chosen for its presentation of
the Bedouin values, such as friendship, loyalty and sacrifice. It also shows the Bedouin
language’s specificities; the understanding of which is central to the understanding of
the Bedouin culture itself. For the benefit of this research work, the story, which is
spoken in Al Hajri’s dialect, the dialect of the Al Hajri tribe in the Gulf, has been
captured on video and presented in three formats   with subtitles in MSA, in Al Hajri
dialect and with no subtitles at all. These three conditions were then tested with three
groups of university students to evaluate their response to and understanding of the
story. The results show that the participants who viewed the video with subtitling   both
the transcription in Al Hajri dialect and the translation into MSA  scored higher than
those who viewed the un subtitled video. This outcome suggests that the use of
subtitled videos can be a valuable tool towards preserving and making known the
language and culture of the local peoples
