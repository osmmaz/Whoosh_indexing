Characterization and treatability studies on a bench scale were carried out for
the petrochemical wastewater of saudi petrochemical company (SADAF) at Al 
Jubail, Saudi Arabia. During wastewater quality survey, hourly samples were
collected from the phosphate stream and the final effluent of the plant. The results
of the analysis indicate that the wastewaters are low in organic content but
variable in concentrations. The average total organic carbon for the phosphate
stream and the final effluent were 73 mg/L and 65 mg/L, respectively.
Batch scale granular activated carbon adsorption studies conducted on
phosphate stream wastewater indicated that low values of initial pH and
temperatures are favorable for adsorption. A nonadsorbable portion of organics
was found to be ubiquitious to this specific wastewater. Bench scale ozonation
studies were also conducted by varying the experimental conditions such as,
detention time, gas flowrate, initial pH and temperature. The maximum reduction
in terms of total organic carbon was 32.5 percent at a pH of 11.4 and temperature
of 60°C. The experimental data fitted well to a first order equation. Furthermore,
the combined ozone/activated carbon was found to remove upto 81 percent of
total organic carbon from the phosphate stream wastewater.
