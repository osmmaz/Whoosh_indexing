This experimental work was carried out using gas oil water three phase flow loop set up
in the Center for Engineering Research of the Research Institute, King Fahd University of
Petroleum and Minerals. The objective of this work was to investigate the flow pattern
and measure the pressure drop in a horizontal pipe with 2.25cm inner diameter and
compare the experimental results with existing models.
