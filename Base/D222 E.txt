ZSM 5 zeolites precursors were synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization
method from aluminosilicate gels in the presence of organic templates:   tetrapropyl
ammonium bromide, and diethanolamine at temperatures o f 175°C under autogeneous
pressure. The materials were characterized by powder X ray diffraction, Infrared
spectroscopy, and benzene adsorption. The course of crystallization was followed by
examining the X ray diffraction pattern o f the calcined samples and the optical density
ratio o f the bands at 550cm'1 and 450cm'1 in the mid IR region o f the structure spectra as a
function of crystallization time. For a well crystalline material, the optical density ratio is
0.70; this ratio was found to be less if amorphous silica is present in zeolite.
The catalytic activity o f the samples has been evaluated for the » hexane cracking
in tubular fixed bed reactor at the temperature range o f 300°C to 500°C. The Cracking
Mechanism Ratio (CMR) calculated reveals that the n hexane cracking reaction over the
catalyst tested proceeds predominantly via protolytic route and catalytic activity o f the
TPABr mediated samples increases with crystallinity. Apparent activation energies are
remarkably similar in spite o f differences in relative level o f activity.
The X ray, IR and n hexane cracking activity data suggests that these zeolite
precursors are microcrystalline solid material in amorphous matrix with structures similar
to that o f ZSM 5. The infrared spectroscopy results were correlated with other structural
data obtained by X ray diffraction, adsorption measurements, and also with the results of
catalytic test.
