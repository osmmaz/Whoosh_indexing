Ductal® is a proprietary ultra high performance concrete (UHPFRC)
cooperatively developed by three companies Lafarge, Bouygues, and Rhodia in France.
Ductal is claimed to be a technological breakthrough UHPFRC, offering very high
compressive strength exceeding 200 MPa and flexural tensile strength exceeding 30
MPa, ductility like plastic or wood, durability like stone, and the aesthetic like ceramics.
This new technology offers the possibility to build structural elements without passive
reinforcements and to combine innovative applications, lightness, and excellent
durability.
Ductal concrete is produced using materials commonly found in concrete: cement,
silica fume, sand, superplasticizer and water, as well as some materials unique to Ductal:
ground quartz and fibers. The various Ductal formulations are all based on an optimized
proportioning, combining homogeneity and granular compacted density to satisfy
rheological criteria (excellent workability and self placing capability), mechanical
criteria (very high compressive strength and non brittle tensile behavior) and durability
criteria (near total invulnerability to all conventional aggressions).
