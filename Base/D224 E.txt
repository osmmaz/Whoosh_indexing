Calcareous soils, locally known as marls, are extensively exploited in the construction
of highways and building foundations. Despite their wide prevalence all over
the world, a review of the literature indicates th a t calcareous soils have received
little attention from the geotechnical community. Therefore, this comprehensive
research program was devoted to study first the characterization and the geotechnical
properties of eastern Saudi calcareous soils.
Marl samples were collected from over 20 different sites in the Eastern Province
of Saudi Arabia. The samples were characterized and their geotechnical properties
were determined. Based on these tests, it was found that marl soils are extremely
sensitive to the molding and testing moisture contents. The existing classification
systems and specifications are of limited applicability to these soils.
Owing to their poor engineering behavior, the second phase of this research
program focused on improvement and stabilization of some selected marl soils.
The selection was based not only on the poor behavior of these soils, but also the
availability of these soils and their potential future use. Mechanical and chemical
soil stabilization techniques were investigated. Chemical stabilization using
cement was found to be an effective and efficient way to significantly improve the
inferior properties of these soils in terms of strength and durability. This research
has opened a new door towards a better and more economical utilization of the
low quality marl soils in eastern Saudi Arabia in particular, and calcareous soils
worldwide in general.
