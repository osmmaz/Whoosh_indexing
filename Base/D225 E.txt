Adding corrosion inhibitors has been found to be one of the most effective methods in
preventing corrosion. The corrosion inhibitors are chemical compounds that are added to
the system to reduce the corrosion rate. The inhibition efficiencies of three novel organic than at flowing conditions but inhibitor (c) showed better inhibition efficiency at flowing
conditions. Among the three inhibitors, inhibitor (a) showed the best inhibition efficiency
for all the tested speeds and concentrations. The adsorption of the three inhibitors under
static and flowing conditions obeyed Langmuir's isotherm for all flow speeds and
inhibitor concentrations.
corrosion inhibitors in IN HC1 were evaluated and investigated under static and flowing
conditions by using a modified rotating disk apparatus. The three new corrosion
inhibitors were synthesized at the Chemistry Department at King Fahd University of
Petroleum & Minerals, Saudi Arabia. The effects of flow speeds and concentration of the
inhibitors on inhibition performance were studied through electrochemical measurements
including Tafel Plots and Linear Polarization techniques.
The peak value phenomenon for Inhibitors (a), (b) and (c) were exhibited at inhibitor
concentration of 100, 25, 25 ppm respectively at static condition. However, at flowing
conditions the optimum concentration of inhibitor (b) was shifted to 50 ppm while
increasing the flow speed did not affect the optimum concentrations for the other two
inhibitors. Inhibitors (a) and (b) showed better inhibition efficiencies at static condition
