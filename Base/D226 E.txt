Mineral Fillers are commonly used in plastics to enhance the performance and reduce the
cost of plastic resins. Uniform distribution of these fillers through the polymer matrix is
one of the main considerations to achieve the desirable properties of composites. Oil Fly
Ash (OFA) was used in this research project as filler in Low density Polyethylene
(LDPE) and its effect on different properties was investigated. OFA was obtained as a
by product from the combustion of fuel in power plants, is cheap filler as compared to the
other traditional fillers. Surface modification or functionalization of OFA by acid
treatment was one of the main goals of this study. It is believed that the surface
modification is an effective technique to achieve good dispersion of filler into the
polymer matrix and hence final properties of polymer composites may be enhanced.
Different parameters were used for OFA functionalization followed by optimization of
these parameters. Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, Scanning Electron
Microscopy/Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X ray Diffraction crystallography of
OFA was undertaken before and after the modification to observe the effect of surface
modification. Also, the Polyethylene grafted Maleic Anhydride (PE g MA) was used to
investigate the attraction of Maleic group with and without the functionalization of fillers.
The effect of OFA on the rheological, morphological, mechanical and thermal properties
was investigated. Different weight fractions of OFA were used in order to investigate the
effect of filler content in the polymer matrix.
