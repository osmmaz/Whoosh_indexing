The flow pattern and the pressure drop of oil water flow in a 2.25 cm inner diameter
acrylic horizontal pipe were studied experimentally. The used oil has a 781 kg/m3 density
and a 1.85 cP viscosity at 25 oC. The experimental data were compared with Trallero,
Brauner, and Torres flow pattern models and with several models of mixture viscosity.
The effect of water salinity on flow pattern map and pressure drop was investigated by
making the water salinity 75 ‰ and comparing the data of oil Tap water with that for oilsaline
water. The added amount of salt caused the density ratio to change from 0.78 to
0.732, and the viscosity ratio to change from1.94 to 1.536. It was noticed that due to the
salt addition, the transition from dispersion of oil in water over a water layer flow pattern
to the dispersion of water in oil and oil in water flow pattern was delayed. Also, it was
noticed that in the stratified with mixture at the interface flow pattern, the waves in saline
water has less amplitudes than that in tap water. For the pressure drop, it was noticed that
the inversion in saline water case happened earlier, and the pressure drop decrease rate
for saline water was found to be less than that for tap water.
