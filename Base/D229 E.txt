synthesized using hydrothermal methods. The Si/Al ratio o f ZSM 5 and Theta 1 was
50, whereas the composition o f the MCM 41 was varied from SiOa/AkOs ratio o f 4.7
to a ratio o f 20.5. The samples were characterized by powder x ray diffraction, ICPAES,
and magic angle solid state nuclear magnetic resonance.
The n hexane cracking activities o f the samples were determined using a fixed bed
system in a micro reactor system. The catalytic activity o f the MCM 41 was
extremely low compared with the microporus molecular sieves, possibly due to the
low acid strength o f the catalytic sites. The most active catalyst for hexane cracking
was ZSM 5 due to the extensive bimolecular cracking activity in the channel
intersections. In case o f the Theta 1, most o f the activity was via mono molecular
protolytic cracking mechanism because o f the 1 D channel system provided by the
structure o f this molecular sieve. The two main parameters that affected the activity
and the mechanism involved were the catalyst structure and the cracking temperature.
In spacious pore structure and at relatively low temperature, bimoluclar cracking was
favored.
The cracking activity o f ZSM 5 and Theta 1 are far higher than that o f the MCM 41
mesoporous materials, because o f the strong interaction o f the reactants with the
surface o f the channel system due to the “nest effect".
