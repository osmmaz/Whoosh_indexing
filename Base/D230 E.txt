The study of charge independence and charge symmetry on
the *Sq N N scattering lengths provides a test of charge
dependent effects of nuclear forces. All possible known
contributions to the scattering lengths are considered to
account for the experimental discrepancies. This problem
was broken into two parts, the first considering the
direct electromagnetic and the second the indirect
electromagnetic effects. The effect on the charge
symmetry breaking correction due to the isospin breaking
part of the QCD Hamiltonian, determined by the up down
current quark mass difference, on the difference of
scattering lengths for charge symmetry is determined.
This is done by first calculating the effect of QCD on the
pion nucleon coupling constants via isospin mixing, giving
rise to CSB one pion exchange (OPEP) and two pion exchange
(TPEP) potentials. The importance of CSB TPEP is
emphasized. The eta nucleon coupling constant appears to
be constrained by experimental values of CS to be very
small.
