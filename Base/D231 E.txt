The synthesis of high silica medium acid MFI zeolites in the laboratory was
successfully achieved by using the rapid crystallization method. These zeolites with
medium acidic strengths are good catalysts for the MTBE synthesis. The synthesized
samples were characterized by FTIR, X ray diffraction technique and thermal
analysis. It was found that these catalysts are 100  crystalline. The catalyst to 1 M
NH4NO3 solution ratio of lg: 150 ml, a temperature of 80 °C and a duration of 1 hour
were found as optimum conditions for ion exchanging process. The modification of
the commercial Y zeolite by impregnation with barium oxide was successful.
However, the modification of the same catalyst by dealumination requires more
investigation in the range of 0.1 0.5 M HC1. Characterization of some commercial,
synthesized and modified zeolite catalysts in terms of their acidity was accomplished
using: (1) TPD of ammonia, (2) FTIR of adsorbed pyridine and (3) XPS of adsorbed
pyridine. It was found that the TPD of ammonia is the most versatile technique in
investigating the acidic properties of the different catalysts employed in this study.
Three different cells were designed and used for conducting the FTIR study
efficiently. The catalytic performance for the MTBE synthesis over some selected
catalysts was evaluated. The reaction of isobutene and methanol to produce MTBE
was carried over commercial HY zeolite, Ba modified HY zeolite, commercial Tisilicalite,
commercial HZSM 5 and laboratory synthesized high silica MFI zeolites.
The MTBE reaction was studied in a fixed bed tubular reaction system. Experiments
were carried out under atmospheric pressure at various temperatures, space velocity
of 32 h r 1 and methanol to isobutene ratio of 2. The temperature was optimized to
100 °C with the highest percent yield of MTBE.
