The Hercynian Unconformity has a profound influence on the petroleum system in the
Paleozoic succession of Saudi Arabia. It controls hydrocarbon migration paths,
entrapment, seal, and reservoir quality.
An integrated multidisciplinary method has been developed in this study in order to
diagnose and characterize the Hercynian Unconformity. The method includes the use of
borehole data such as images logs, open hole logs and core; seismic data; palynology and
outcrop description. This method is considered to be a better approach to understand the
unconformity than the previous studies. It covers a wider exposure compared to previous
studies, and which focused only on open hole logs, stratigraphic cross sections, isopach
and isochron maps. The criteria employed in this study included the unconformity and its
related facies, bedding angular discordance and palynology, for data obtained from the
borehole data. It also involved study and analysis of truncation and onlap interpreted in
seismic data. Strike, dip measurements and lithology description from the field data.
The results obtained from this study indicate that the Hercynian Unconformity manifests
itself in unconformity related facies such as breccias and conglomerates, soft deformed
sediments, and paleosols, all which indicate a period of nondeposition. Angular
discordance in image logs is highly correlated with field data and is characterized by dip
changes in both azimuth and magnitude. This indicates either structural tilting or faulting
typically associated with unconformities. Seismic data reveals truncation and onlap,
which are significant unconformity indicators.
