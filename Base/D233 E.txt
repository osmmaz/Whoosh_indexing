In the present study the cross sections of the following reactions have been caculated
in the frame work of the impulse approximation:
where X stands for H, He+1, Li+2, C+s, N+6, 0 + 7 and Fe+25. Though the impulse
approximation was introduced as an improvement on the Bom approximation, it was
found to be systematically worse for scattering of electrons off atoms. However, for
electron capture total cross sections from hydrogenic stsyems by positrons, in the energy
range for which the impulse approximation is valid, the impulse approximation seems
to be better. In this thesis the calculation shows features in the differential cross
sections which indicate that even if the impulse approximation proves worse than the
Bom approximation for the total cross sections in these cases, the differential cross
section may be better described by it.
