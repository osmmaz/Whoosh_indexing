Despite the extensive distribution o f sabkha soil in many countries in
the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East, particularly along the coastal areas, a
review of the published literature indicates that these types o f soil have
received little attention from the geotechnical community to improve their
inferior properties. There exist some “ pilot ” studies, however, they can not
be generalized to all sabkhas due to the heterogeneous nature of these soils.
In this research program, a “selected” sabkha soil from Al Qurayyah,
eastern Saudi Arabia, was researced for: (i) characterization, (ii) preliminary
stabilization using chemical additives, namely cement and lime, and (iii)
detailed stabilization program using one o f the stabilizers only. The test
results indicated that lime did not bring about significant improvement and
therefore was excluded in the detailed stabilization o f Al Qurayyah sabkha.
However, the 7  cement content by weight o f diy soil improved the strength
of Al Qurayyah sabkha soil significantly. Many tests were conducted
including compaction, CBR, unconfined compressive strength, resilient
modulus and durability
The parameters studied in the detailed stabilization program using
cement were: (i) cement content, (ii) exposure conditions, (iii) moisture
content, (iv) exposure period, (v) delay in compaction, and (vi) exposure
temperature.
The results of this investigation indicated that cement addition has
proven to be feasible, economical and the stabilized soil has satisfied both the
strength and durability requirements. Furthermore, cement addition increased
the strength of Al Qurayyah sabkha soil sharply and gave over 500 
improvement compared to the ontreated sabkha soil. However, this stabilized
sabkha soil can be used as subbase or subgrade in roads and other
constructions.
