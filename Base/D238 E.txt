Background and objectives: Significant increases in rates of Clostridium difficile
associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported globally. However, there is a paucity of
epidemiological data on CDAD in Saudi Arabia. This study was conducted to assess
incident and associated risk factors for CDAD in Saudi Arabia.
Methodology: Prospective hospital based surveillance for CDAD was conducted from
June November 2015 in a tertiary health care facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Surveillance definitions were adopted from the United States Center for Disease
Prevention and Control (CDC). Knowledge assessment surveys using validated
questionnaires designed to collect data on knowledge about CDAD and related infection
control measures were carried out. The questionnaires were administered to randomly
selected healthcare workers. A simplified 7 item questionnaire was employed for
housekeepers while a detailed 22 item questionnaire was administered to other
categories of healthcare workers. SPSS version 20 (IBM, Chicago, USA) was employed
for statistical analysis. CDAD incident density per 10,000 patient days was calculated
and Pareto analysis was implemented to identify the most common risk factors.
Descriptive analysis of collected data was performed.
