The Steiner Tree Problem is the determination of the shortest connecting length
between a given set of points and additional points. The Rectilinear Steiner Tree
Problem is the same as above but the connecting lines an' confined to the horizontal
or vertical lines only (L\ metric). A cluster is a set of points that 'influence' each
other locally. This research gives a new algorithm based 011 a clustering metric that
determines much less steiner points locally in a cluster as well as those external to
it. The algorithm matches the worst case time complexity of O(iilotjn) of previous
authors while giving better average results then theirs. In addition, a Neural Solution
to the Steiner problem in Networks, which is a graph theoretic representation of the
problem, is explored and its limitations presented.
