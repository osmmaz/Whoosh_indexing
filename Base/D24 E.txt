Qatar has emerged as a rising regional player in the past decade or so. Qatar’s foreign
policy played a prominent role in mediation of various crises. Despite its small size,
Qatar managed to be effective and its active role also raised questions and concerns in the
international arena.
I have chosen to study the Qatari and Turkish relations in terms of three basic aspects,
namely political, economic and military relation and I have chosen those aspects after
noticing the depth of the relationship between the two countries and its transformation
from a routine international relation to a strategic relation linked by a common destiny. It
is noticed also that Qatar and Turkey have played a prominent role in the Arab Spring
through standing with the people needs and asking for their rights. The geopolitics and
dynamics in the region has necessitated a strategic relation for both countries in
particular, and they share the same culture and follow the same political ideology, in
addition both state are seeking for the stability and tranquility in the region. This research
is an analytical study of Qatar Turkey relations from the three aspects mentioned above,
as it would provide policy diagnostics and recommendations for the other GCC states as
well as the countries in the region that may contribute to the develop the relationship
between them and help serve their common interest regionally and globally.
