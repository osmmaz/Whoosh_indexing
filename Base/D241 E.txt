Code synchronisation is as an attempt to synchronise the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. The process of acquiring
the timing information of the transmitted spread spectrum signal is essential to the implementation of any form of spread
spectrum technique. The overall system performance is dictated by the code acquisition subsystem since other subsystems
rely on a successful code Acquisition
In C D M A systems, the signal to inteference plus noise ratio at the receiver depends on the chip pulse shape used in
spreading the user signals. The peformance of the acquisition system was extended using the Improved Gaussian
approximation which gives a better account of the e ffect of interference on the CDM A system.
The threshold should be set above the noise level, thus an estimate of this figure is required by the detector. Under stable
channel conditions the threshold can be fixed but in dynamic channel conditions, where interference is present, adaptive
threshold schemes should be used. It is necessary to design an acquisition threshold with its value being set according the
effective SIN R . A modified threshold setting system is proposed for the Hybrid search scheme. A modified threshold
setting scheme was proposed for the Hybrid Search scheme.
Implementation of the algorithms was also carried out on a Texas TMS320C6713.
