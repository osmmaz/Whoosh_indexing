An electrochemical hydrogen permeation measurement system
was designed, constructed and successfully used. The good agreement
between the values of the diffusion coefficients for the hydrogen atoms
in steel obtained by us and those obtained by other workers established
the reliability of our system. A characteristic hump was observed in
several hydrogen permeation curves. We propose that this hump is due
to the trapping of hydrogen at sites other than voids and microvoids.
This electrochemical system was adapted to study the
effectiveness of diethanolamine (DEA), morpholine (MOR),
triethanolamine (TEA), ethylenediamine (EDA), and hexamethylene
diamine (HMDA) in inhibiting the entry of hydrogen atoms into steel.
The diamines were found to be more effective than the monoamines,
and a nonlinear relationship was observed between the increase of
inhibition and the concentration of the amines studied.
The inhibiting abilities of the monoamines were similar at the
higher concentration limit (0.01 M) and followed the trend TEA > MOR
> DEA at the low concentration limit (5 x 10'5M). For the diamines the
inhibiting abilities were also similar at their high concentration limit
(5 x 1 0 '3M) and followed the trend HMDA > EDA at the low
concentration limit (5 x 10‘5M).
