The exponential increase in demand of biological systems has renewed
research in very low frequency circuit techniques. Developing new fully integrated
solutions exhibiting improved characteristics is highly desired. Area, linearity, noise
and power consumption are the main performance indicators of biomedical
applications. In this thesis, various techniques to realize low power and low
frequency (LPLF) operation are investigated. Consequently, new circuit design
solutions are developed.
