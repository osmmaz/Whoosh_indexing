Chemometn'c optimization methodologies have been utilized for the
development of quantitative methods of analysis of some drugs using flow
injection (Fl) techniques. Super modified simplex procedures together with
statistical design techniques have been used for optimization and modeling of
response surface. The sequential optimization has validated the flow injection
methods proposed with excellent reproducibility, high sensitivity, and a wide
dynamic range. A sampling frequency of not less than 120 h'1 was obtained for all
methods developed.
