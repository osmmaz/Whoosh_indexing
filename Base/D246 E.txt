Accelerated and ambient storage stability tests were conducted using
model nitrogen compounds in petroleum derived jet A fuel and n decane,
indicating that the rate of sediment formation was dependent on the structural
features of nitrogen compounds, the nature of diluent employed and storage
conditions. Air, increased temperature, dissolved oxygen and light all strongly
accelerate the sediment formation rate but the removal of dissolved oxygen
from the base fuel (jet A fuel and n decane) significantly reduced the rate.
Carboxylic acids act as an accelerator while phenols inhibitor toward sediment
formation with nitrogen containing compounds. The reaction has a low
apparent activation energy and appears to involve a free radical oxidative self
condensation of nitrogen compounds. Characterization of sediment was made
by elemental analysis, infrared and mass spectroscopy. The lower O/C ratios of
sediment proved that the oxidation is a key aspect of je t fuel thermal instability.
Approximately 25 different types of possible compounds were identified from
average properties of 2,5 dimethylpyrrole sediments. Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopies were applied to the characterization of average
molecular structural parameters of various fuel samples containing varying
amounts of parrafinic and aromatic constituents with the help of computer
programming.
