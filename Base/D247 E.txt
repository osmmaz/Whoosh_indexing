In the past two decades, model predictive control (MPC) technology has gained its
industrial position in refinery and petrochemical industries and is beginning to attract
interest from other process industries. Model development remains by far the most
critical and time consuming step in implementing industrial MPC. Conventionally,
models are identified through a series o f single variable open loop step tests. Overtime
these models change due to a number o f reasons such as change in operating
conditions, instability o f the process, drift in process and environmental conditions.
This causes control performance problems. For this reason, multivariable closed loop
identification is proposed for MPC. Identification techniques based on autoregressive
moving average (ARMA), state space and neural network models are investigated.
These techniques are tested through computer simulations and ultimately on field data
from an industrial process. Direct Identification method is employed for this purpose.
