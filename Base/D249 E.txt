Aluminum alloys are very economical and attractive for a wide variety of applications
because of their lightweight, ease of fabrication, optimum combination of physical
properties, improved mechanical properties and superior corrosion resistance. Scandium,
with its unique strength and weight saving characteristics has been introduced as a
potential alloying element in several aluminum alloys. Sc addition brings about dramatic
improvements in the mechanical and physical characteristics of aluminum alloys.
Scandium provides highest increase in strength per atomic percent of any alloying
element has created a great deal of interest in the aluminum industry.
To explore the high performance capabilities, one of the most vital parameter  
corrosion which affects the service performance has been left unaddressed by researchers
and needed to be investigated to determine the application potential of these alloys. The
work conducted involved the corrosion studies of Al Mg Sc Zr alloys in corrosive
environment on which relatively little work has been done. Al Mg Sc Zr alloys
containing scandium ranging from 0 0.9 wt  Sc and 0.14 wt  Zr were used for
corrosion studies in 3.5 wt  NaCl. Corrosion studies included weight loss,
electrochemical studies, impingement test, velocity test and elevated temperature
polarization studies. Micro structural studies include SEM and EDS analysis to identify
the constituents. Mechanical properties of the alloys were determined by conducting
tensile tests at room temperature and elevated temperatures.
