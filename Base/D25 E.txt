The aim of this letter is to study the custodianship of men offer women in the books of
interpretation and its implementation in the Qatari Community. We have taken two sides in this
study; theoretical and applied sides. In the theoretical side, we have done some analysis and
discussion and have illustrated the opinions of interpreters in the meaning of custodianship in the
past and present .
We have cleared the concept of custodianship and have found out a difference among
interpreters in this meaning from time to time. We based this difference to many reasons from it;
the change in the meaning of the word (custodianship), the difference in cultures, and the change
in the environmental legacies. We have discussed the terms of custodianship and their
requirements; also we have discussed the suspicions around custodianship and the responses to
them .
In the applied side, we have done some interviews with consultants at the Family
Consulting Center (FCC), and questioners have been distributed to the students of Qatar University
and the visitors of Family Consulting Center (FCC), then we have analyzed the questioners .
