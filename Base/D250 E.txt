Corrosive behavior o f mild steel type 1018 in a typical drilling fluid used in drilling
deep and hot wells was studied. The studies were carried out under simulated flow
conditions, temperature, and pressure; which drilling fluid and drill pipe are exposed to
while drilling such wells using a dynamic flow loop. Corrosion monitoring and
measurements were carried out by weight loss and electrochemical techniques. The
electrochemical techniques  >re: Polarization resistance, Potentiodynamic plots and AC
impedance test. They were used to characterize the corrosion behavior o f the steel in
drilling fluid. Scanning electron microscope was also used to study the general morphology
changes o f steel samples when exposed to drilling fluid under simulated downhole
Results show that corrosion rate increases with increase in temperature and
decrease in pH. Corrosion rates are low at mildly alkaline to mildly acidic pH range. The
drilling fluid generally attacks the grain boundaries o f the steel. Diffusion was found to be
the rate limiting step for the corrosion reaction. Once diffusion resistance is overcome by
increased flow rate or agitation, the corrosiveness o f mud increases tremendously.
Diffusion resistance led to a capricious and non linear kinetic behavior. Experiments
conducted at high agitation will give a better understanding o f mud corrosion reaction
kinetics.
