Due to the huge number of distribution transformers yearly consumed and installed in
the utility networks, it is always required and targeted to build transformers with the
most economical cost. Achieving the guaranteed characteristics of transformers is an
important factor that should be considered. It is well know that the transformer design
task is time consuming. In this thesis a successful attempt for designing distribution
transformers up to 34.5 kV and 1500 kVA using optimization techniques is presented.
Two optimization techniques to obtain the optimal design of distribution transformers
are proposed. Nonlinear programming (NL) algorithm is the first technique while the
second one is Genetic Algorithms (GA). The transformer design mathematical
formulation is explained in a systematic way for the conventional type of distribution
transformers. Optimization methodologies and implementation results are presented.
Results show the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical formulation of the transformer design problem and the reduction of total cost when compared to
conventional designs
