Metallic materials are widely used in the industry due to their superior mechanical
properties and offshore structures are one example from the industry that usually
uses the metallic materials such as carbon steel to support the daily operation of the
concern oil and gas facilities. However, these metallic materials are subjected to
corrosive conditions like aqueous environment. Therefore, a corrosion protection
technique like external coating must be considered to prevent and mitigate corrosion
process from initiation and then damage the target structures. Solution plasma spray
technique (SPS) showed the ability to produce Aluminum oxide nano structured
coating by oxidizing aluminum nitrate nona hydrate solution as achieved in this
research.
Aluminum oxide nano structured coating has several applications in the industry as a
corrosion protection layer like insulator due to its high wear resistance and hardness.
In this thesis, three different concentrations with three different flowrates of
aluminum nitrate solution were involved to prepare different aluminum oxide nanostructured
coating system. These coating systems were studied and characterized
using several techniques such as AC Impedance, X ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning
electron microscope (SEM). Accordingly, the generated coating systems have showed slight improvements. Furthermore, concentration of the aluminum nitrate
nona hydrate salt can be reduced by 40   50 wt.   and still can achieve same
aluminum oxide structure
