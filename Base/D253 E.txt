The coupled bending and torsional vibration of a rotating tapered shaft based on
Timoshenho beam theory is presented by means of the finite element technique. The shaft
which is assumed to have. circular cross section and linear taper is discretized into a
number of finite elements with ten degrees of freedom each. The equation of motion of the
rotating tapered shaft finite element is derived using Lagrange equation. Explicit
expressions for the finite element mass. stifliiess and gyroscopic matrices are derived by
using consistent mass formulation. The shaft finite element is integrated into a procedure to
calculate the natural fi'equecies of rotor bearing systems. The generalized eigenvalue
problem is defined and numerical solutions are generated/or a wide range of whirl ratios,
spin speeds and taper ratios. Comparisons are made with exact solutions and with
numerical results available in the literature. The results display high accm'aqv when
compared to other numerical results.
