This research addresses the practice of building cost estimation in the
Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firms located in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. It
explored the extent to which local (A/E) firms carry out the practice of cost estimation along
different phases of building projects development. The study addresses the types of cost
estimates that (A/E) firms develop for their clients, the procedures followed in preparing
these cost estimates and the assessment of (A/E) project managers of the effectiveness of
these cost estimates and their recommendations on ways to improve the present cost
estimation system.
A pre established preliminary questionnaires were mailed to all (A/E) firms operating
in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia in order to solicit their interest in particiapting in the
study and to determine their conformance to the study criteria. The (A/E) firms who
expressed their interest to participate in the study and exhibited their conformance to the
study criteria were provided with the main questionnaires which were designed to solicit
needed information for this study.
Some of the (A/E) firms in Saudi Arabia provide cost estimation as part of their
engineering and consultancy services. They develop all different types of cost estimates
such as feasibility, budget and design estimates. They provide cost estimation services
along with supervision for most of the projects and for most of the major clients such as
public, Saudi Aramco, SABIC, SCECO, etc. The cost estimation procedures used are
manually developed and, therefore, are labor intensive, costly, with inconsistent results
and hard to check and update. However, when the results of these procedures were
compared with bid prices, good results were obtained.
