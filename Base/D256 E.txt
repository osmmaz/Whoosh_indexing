This study addresses the effect o f temperature and weld line on monotonic and fatigue
crack growth (FCG) behavior o f Chlorinated PVC (CPVC). Tensile and FCG tests were
conducted on weld and non weld CPVC specimens in the temperature range —10 to
70 °C. These specimens were prepared from 4 inch injection molded pipe fittings. The
results showed mechanical properties like yield stress and elastic modulus decrease with
temperature increase. The presence o f weld line was observed to drastically reduce the
mechanical strength o f CPVC. Crack growth behavior was studied using LEFM
concepts. The effective stress intensity factor range AKejf gave satisfactory correlation o f
crack growth rate (da/dN) at all temperatures o f interest. The crack growth resistance
was found to decrease with temperature increase. The weld line showed higher crack
growth rate and lower fatigue life as compared to non weld. Crack opening displacement
also gave acceptable correlation o f da/dN at all test temperatures. Crazing was found to
be the dominant fatigue mechanism, especially at high temperature, while shear yielding
was the dominant mechanism at low temperatures.
