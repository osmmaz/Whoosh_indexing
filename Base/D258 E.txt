Near surface diffractors are one of the problems in land seismic exploration. They
can scatter the surface wave energy emanating from the seismic source and contaminate
the signal received by seismic receivers. The scattered energy from the near surface
diffractors manifests itself on seismic shot gathers as strong hyperbolic events, called
diffractions, masking the weak reflected body waves. Diffractions present complications
to most of surface waves suppression schemes, especially when they have been scattered
by scatterers away from the line of receivers. Different methods have been tried to
eliminate diffractions from seismic data e.g., geophone arrays, filtering, and inverse
scattering of Rayleigh waves. Each of those methods has its own limitations. In this thesis
processing algorithms to map near surface diffractors of surface waves and attenuate
their diffracted energy in seismic shot gathers are presented. The mapping algorithm is
based on semblance measurement and time offset relation while the attenuation algorithm
is based on least mean square best fit of Ricker wavelet. The algorithms have been
applied on synthetic data from two different models. The first model has three nearsurface
diffractors while the second model has three clusters of near surface diffractors.
Each cluster consists of three near surface diffractors, with distances between them
varying form one cluster to another. The results of both algorithms were excellent in most
of the cases. They only had problems when the separation between individual diffractors
is below the expected wavelength of the surface wave.
