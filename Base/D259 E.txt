Cryogenic machining is gaining increasing acceptance in metal industries and is
replacing the conventional machining processes to overcome the shortcomings o f the
conventional coolants. Materials like aramid fibre reinforced composite are difficult to
machine because o f the unique combination o f physical properties o f fibre and the matrix.
The present study evaluates the machinability o f Kevlar™ 49 composite laminates at low
temperatures using TiN coated HSS drill.
The effects o f workpiece temperature and cutting conditions on machinability o f
laminates were assessed using drilling thrust force, cutting torque, specific energy and
hole quality. Both workpiece temperature and machining conditions were found to
influence each o f maximum thrust force, maximum torque and specific cutting energy at
different levels. Both drilling thrust and torque showed increasing trend with decrease in
the workpiece temperature under all machining conditions. Drilled hole patterns o f the
laminates obtained using optical technique showed less fibre protrusion and delamination
at low temperatures compared to ambient. An improvement o f about 400  was observed
when the workpiece temperature was reduced from 20“C to  120°C.
