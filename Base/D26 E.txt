This study aims to research the discretionary practice of supplication . Based on an
analysis of interviews with highly educated Sunni Muslim women in Qatar, the multiple
meanings of supplication are identified. The study explores how this group of religious
women debates and argues the correct usages of pious formulae using their reflexive
Islamic knowledge.
In the testimonies of interviewees, supplication appears efficacious when practiced in
situations of vulnerability. Change was evident to them in their psychological and
emotional state; the emotional state being not only the result, but indeed a precondition
for entreating the Divine.
This practice also proved to be an important spiritual venue. Indeed, it may serve to
counter the notion   perpetuated in the classical Orientalist literature of a spiritual void
supposedly characteristic for the central practices of Sunni Islam. For interviewees, the
spiritual life was constituted by acts of asking for His benevolence and the concomitant
experiences of God’s companionship and connectedness.
Furthermore, this practice is informed by notions of Islamic virtue ethics, functioning
also as an element in a broader process of self education and cultivation of specific
Islamic virtues.
The participants in this research agree that conformity with Islamic doctrine [manhaj] as
a requirement for requests to be granted by God. In some cases, however, their diverse
religious orientations led to differences in their understanding and way of practice.
