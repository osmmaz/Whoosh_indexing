High level synthesis is the process of translating a high level program like specification
of the behavior of a digital circuit into a structural design in terms of interconnected
set of Register Transfer level components. Component selection and pipelining is
one of the important problems in HLS. We investigate the application of Stochastic
Evolution (SE) for solving component selection and pipelining and compare it with
Simulated Annealing (SA) for the same computation time. The inputs are a Data
Flow Graph (DFG), a realistic component library with multiple implementations of
operators and Latency and Pipe stage delay constraints. Component selection involves
replacing components of the DFG by slower components to minimize the cost.
The cost function is the sum of costs (in gates) of all the components of the DFG
and the pipeline registers. Pipelining is done based on the constraints of latency
and pipe stage delay specified. A new method of improving the results in SE, called
post processing is proposed. This is called Modified Stochastic Evolution (MSE) technique.
In post processing, after obtaining a valid state the DFG is scanned to see
if there is a possibility of replacing one or more components by slower components
of the same type without violating the constraints. Experiments were carried out on
different types of DFGs. The performance of SA is better than SE without postprocessing,
while SE performs better than SA in some cases when post processing is
introduced.
