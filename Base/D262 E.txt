Quality control can be divided into statistical process control and product
control. The product control area can also be divided into complete inspection
plans and acceptance sampling plans. Complete inspection plans are becoming
increasingly im portant in the area of quality control due to the growth in modern
m anufacturing systems th a t make complete inspection inexpensive and reliable.
This thesis proposes a new complete inspection plan for m ulticharacteristic
critical components. Optim ization models which depict the plan are developed
with the necessary algorithms and software. Comparisons w ith th e existing models
in the literature are carried out using randomly generated inspection problems.
Efforts to explicitly incorporate m aterial handling cost in th e inspection process
are made.
The general model in the thesis referred to as model (2) performed b etter in
terms of expected to tal cost of inspection than the models in the literature, in
75 80 percent of th e random ly generated problems. The savings in total expected
costs range from 1 20 percent. Incorporating m aterial handling cost improved the
performance of the proposed plan compared to th e ones in the literature. This
was expected due to less m aterial handling involvements in th e proposed plan.
