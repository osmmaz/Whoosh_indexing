To improve understanding and interpretation o f the M iddle M iocene foraminifera,
samples o f Recent foraminifera from the nearshore Arabian G ulf was examined and
compared with similar foraminiferal biocom ponents o f the Dam Formation carbonates at
Jabal Midra Al Janubi. Eleven samples from the Arabian G ulf and 60 samples from the
Dam Formation at Eastern Saudi Arabia were collected and analyzed using standard
m icropaleontological techniques. A total o f 47 species from the G u lf were identified to be
Recent origin, consisting o f 2 agglutinated, 21 miliolid and 24 rotalid species. The Dam
Formation had 51 species, consisting o f 3 agglutinated, 37 m iliolid and 11 rotalids. The
presence o f species Borelis melo in the Dam Formation confirms its M iddle Miocene age.
Analysis o f the Arabian G ulf foraminiferal environment revealed that
foraminiferal diversity tends to increase with depth but decrease with salinity. Similar
trends in the foraminiferal biocomponents at the Dam Formation have been interpreted to
provide a new palaeoenvironmental understanding, and similarities o f the foraminiferal
biofacies o f the Middle M iocene and Recent.
Results further indicate the foraminiferal fossils at the Dam Formation
commenced deposition following a slight marine transgression over an eroded Palaeogene
surface during the M iddle Miocene, under highly adverse, hypersaline conditions.
Successive small scale marine transgressions, with normal salinity, led to foraminiferal
colonization and the accumulation o f foraminiferal wackestones, packstones and
grainstones. These minor fluctuations led to the developm ent o f shoaling upwards cycles,
in which the foraminifera and grain sizes responded to increasing energy conditions as
well as slight elevations in salinity, as evidence by the concentrations o f hypersalinetolerant
m iliolid foraminifera.
