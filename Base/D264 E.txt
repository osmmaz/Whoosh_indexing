The objectives of this work are to measure the binary adsorption equilibrium
data of propane and n butane on 5A and 13X zeolites, and to
model th e behavior of this system. This will provide a basis fo r the
choice of the best conditions fo r separation of these gases by zeolites.
Data of pure component sorption of propane and n butane on 5A and
13X zeolites fo r tem peratures of 348, 423 and 498 K is reported. Binary
sorption data fo r these two components at the same temperatures are
also reported fo r total pressures of 66.7 and 106.7 kPa .T h e pure component
data is modelled using the Schirmer et a l., Ruthven, vacancy
solution and viria l models. In general the Schirmer et al. model gives
the best fit. The form of the virial model used here presents the pure
component data in generalized form .
The binary data is found to be approxim ately ideal . The selectivity
coefficient fo r propane, which is the reciprocal of the relative volatility
, is found to be in the range of 0 .0 8 to 0.40 fo r the temperatures
and pressures studied. The separation increases with decreasing
tem perature and shows a slight increase with decreasing pressure. The
5A zeolites gives a smaller selectivity coefficient and hence larger separation
than the 13X zeolite. However the difference between the selectivities
coefficients fo r the two zeolites is small. The binary data is modelled using the Schirmer et a l., Ruthven et a l., vacancy solution
and I AST binary models. In general the Schirmer et al. and the ideal
adsorption solution theory (IA S T ) models give the best f it
