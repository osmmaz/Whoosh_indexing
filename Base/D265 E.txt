During a construction project, delays may result from many
circumstances. Delays may be caused by the owner, the contractor, by acts of
god, or a third party. They may occur early or late in the job, alone or with other
delays. Negotiating a fair and timely damage settlement, is beneficial to all
parties. Network based scheduling is an excellent vehicle for negotiating
settlement of changes, disputes and delays throughout the project. In the
construction industry there is no single, standard and “accepted" procedure to
determine impact of schedule delays due to change orders or other unplanned
developments. In this thesis, four delay measurement processes are studied.
These procedures are employed to measure delay impact, utilizing computerized
CPM analyses, performed on genuine construction schedules. Results indicate
that outcomes of delay analyses are not predictable, nor can one method be
used universally. It is determined however, that in given circumstances, one
procedure can be more befitting than another.
