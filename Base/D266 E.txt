Several methods have been developed for solving the system of linear
equations that arise in approximating the solution of two dimensional reservoir
flow equations. Those methods solve the system of linear equations either
directly or iteratively.
In this thesis a comparative study of the most commonly used methods is
made. The study includes a full analysis of each method plus a comparison of the
computing efficiencies in terms of both the computation times and the memory
space requirements. It also includes a discussion of grid ordering techniques that
have appeared in the literature.
The test problem used in the comparison is a homogeneous, two phase
(oil water), two dimensional five spot water flooding. A simple two phase three
dimensional reservoir simulator was used. The results showed D4 Gaussian
Elimination method to be the most efficient of the direct methods while the Point
Successive Over relaxation method was the most efficient among the iterative
techniques. Nested Factorization method had the fastest convergence of all the
iterative techniques.
