The performance of three different feedback control systems has been studied in
controlling the vibration of a rotor bearing system. Two Different mathematical models
of the rotor bearing system have been presented. One model is developed by considering
the rotor bearing system on rigid supports and another model is developed by considering
the system on flexible supports. The control techniques applied on these models are: the
State variable feedback , Integral plus state variable feedback and Linear quadratic servo.
The response of the deflection of the rotor has been simulated on a digital computer. The
results of the simulation are presented. These control techniques have been compared on
the basis of time response specifications. The relative suitability of controllers is discussed.
The effect of the flexibility of the supports, on the response of the rotor deflection has been
studied. The results obtained for different support stiffnesses are discussed.
