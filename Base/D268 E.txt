Detecting anomalous tra c on the Internet has remained an issue of concern
for the community of security researchers over the years. The advances in the
area of computing performance, in terms of processing power and storage, have
fostered their ability to host resource intensive intelligent algorithms, to detect
intrusive activity, in a timely manner. As part of this thesis, we study and analyze
the performance of two such machine learning algorithms, namely, Average
One Dependency Estimators (AODE) and Abductive networks (GMDH), when
implemented as part of an intrusion detection system, to detect anomalies on a
dataset of Internet tra c activity. The simulation results obtained for the two
approaches are compared and analyzed based on several performance metrics.
