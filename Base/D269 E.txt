Mobile communication systems are usually maligned by the presence
of Doppler frequencies as there exists a relative motion between the
transmitter and the receiver. Modulation schemes that have potential
immunity to frequency offsets have been a topic of interest since the development
of mobile technology. Double differential phase shift keying
(DDPSK) is one among such schemes and has the advantage of being simple.
In this thesis, DDPSK is analyzed over fading channels taking into
effect the presence of frequency offsets, as fading and Doppler frequencies
characterize a mobile channel.
Though the scheme is simple, analysis show that the performance of
DDPSK is poor when compared to the conventional differential phase
shift keying (DPSK). In order to overcome this shortcoming, a receiver
structure has been proposed in the present work. By utilizing the proposed
receiver model, it has been found that the probability of error
obtained is less than that of the conventional DPSK.
All analytical results showed good agreement with the Monte Carlo
simulations.
