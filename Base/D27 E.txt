With the proliferation of Islamic banks and the development of their activities over the last
few decades, some banking products have emerged with similar content and functions as
conventional banking products, such as cash financing products for individuals. This puts the
fatwas issued by Islamic banks' Shariah supervisory boards (SSB) related to these products
under scrutiny. However, research and studies on this issue are lacking. Hence, this study
aims to fill this gap by analysing products which enable customers of Islamic bank to get
cash, including through cash personal finance, cash withdrawal by credit card, and use of
overdraft facilities. The study is based on analysis and comparison between the fatwas issued
in Southeast Asia and those issued in the Arab Gulf states. The study noted that there is a
phenomenon of evolution in the banking fatwas. This evolution is heading to the legalization
of products mimicing conventional banking products, which calls for revision and
reconsideration of the methodology of SSBs when passing rulings on any banking product.
Therefore, the study calls for the need to reconsider the methodology in giving permission for
any banking product by focusing on its core before its formality, and urges Islamic banks to
develop products that distinguish them from conventional banks.
