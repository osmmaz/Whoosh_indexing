The objective o f this thesis is to investigate the composite generation and transmission
planning model in a competitive environment. This study includes the traditional power
system planning models and applications. The generation and transmission planning
models under deregulation recently reported in the literature are discussed. New
generation and transmission planning model under deregulation is formulated as an
optimization problem. The branch and bound (B&B) algorithm is employed to search for
optimal solution o f the new optimization problem. In addition, this study presents a
comparison between the traditional planning model and the new deregulation planning
model. The models are simulated and tested under different power networks and the
simulation results presented a considerable investments cost saving using the new
deregulation planning model.
