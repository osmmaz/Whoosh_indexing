Electromagnetic fields, produced by the transmission lines on nearby oil and gas buried
pipelines and underground communication cables, generate uncontrolled voltages which
can be a safety problem and distort communications. This research evaluates and analyzes
the electromagnetic interference effects on oil and gas buried pipelines and underground
communication cables created by the nearby high voltage transmission lines in the Eastern
Province of Saudi Arabia. The study revealed that the maximum induced voltage on all
buried pipelines and communication cables during the steady state condition is within the
standard limit. However, the results during the short circuit condition exceed the safety
limits on some buried pipelines. A mitigation system using gradient control wires has
been simulated to reduce the pipeline potential to the safety limit.
