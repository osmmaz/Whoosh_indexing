The structural stability o f a chosen set o f important ketenes was investigated using ab
initio calculations. The 6 311 ^G ** extended basis set at the DFT B3LYP level was
employed in most o f the work. Full energy optim ization was perform ed at the ground
states as well as the transition states for the systems under the study. It was found that
when the conjugation effect in formyl ketene. fluorocarbonyl ketene. chlorocarbonyl
ketene and vinyl ketene is dominant, theses systems exist as a mixture o f cis and trans
conformations. M oreover, they were o f a relatively high calculated rotational barrier as
compared to the corresponding isocyanates. In the case of non conjugated ketenic
systems, such as trifiuorom ethyl ketene and chlorom ethyl ketene, the barrier to
interconversion was calculated to be considerably low er and the gauche form was
expected to appear as a stable form. In such systems, the steric effect, the intramolecular
electrostatic attraction and the molecular orbital destabilization may play competitive
roles in controlling the conformational behavior. The cis form was calculated to be the
most stable conform ation in tri  and difluoromethyl ketene with the gauche conformation
being the less stable form in only the difluoro derivative. W hile in halomethyl ketene only
the gauche form was the stable form. Additionally, com plete normal coordinate analyses
were perform ed to derive the potential energy distributions (PED) for each stable
conformation in the m olecular systems. The calculated vibrational spectra for each system
w ere plotted and reliable assignments o f the vibrational wavenumbers wrere made based
on the vibrational frequencies, calculated PED values. Raman activities, IR intensities,
depolarization ratios as well as the observed frequencies o f similar molecules.
