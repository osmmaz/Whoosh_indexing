Numerical simulation of flow past airfoils is important in ike aerodynamic design
of aircraft wings and turbomachinery components. These lifting devices often attain
optimum performance at the condition of onset of separation. Therefore separation
phenomena must be included if the analysis is aimed at practical applications.
Consequently, in the present study, numerical simulation of steady flow in a linear
cascade of NACA 0012 airfoils is accomplished using a numerical scheme employing
control volume approach. The flow field is determined by solving two dimensional
incompressible Navier Stokes equations while the effects of turbulence are accounted
for by the k e model. Separation point at the airfoil surface is predicted at high angles
of attack. Pressure, lift and drag coefficients are computed and the results are
compared with the predictions of isolated single NACA 0012 airfoil. The study is extended
to include the effects of stagger angle of the cascade and rotating boundaries
of the isolated airfoil on the flow characterstics. It is found that increase in solidity
and/or stagger angle increases the angle of attack at which separation occurs and
pressure, lift and drag coefficients are highly influenced by the angle of attack and
the solidity ratios. For the case of airfoil leading edge rotation a reduction in the
wake size is predicted at high angle o f attack. For this case an increase in the lift
and a decrease in the drag coefficient is also predicted.
