The variation in the composition with the depth in hydrocarbon reservoirs has
been observed by technologists in oil industry. This variation, in several cases,
was a result of gravity forces. The concentration of the lighter components tend
to be more towards the top of the reservoir and the concentration of the heavier
components tend to be more towards the bottom of the reservoir. Several
authors suggested some algorithms to predict this variation. These algorithms
were used as a tool to investigate reservoir continuity and determine the gas oil
contact (GOC) depth.
In this study, the technique of compositional gradient calculations is used in a
real field data for one of the Saudi gas condensate reservoirs to address the
reservoir continuity and investigate the possibility of having a GOC in the
reservoir. The study showed that the reservoir is not continuous and there is no
GOC in the reservoir. Also the results were supported by reservoir geology 3 0
seismic that showed faults in the area of interest. The findings of this study are
essential for the development of such reservoir since a gas cycling project will
be needed to maximize the condensate recovery.
