Computerized Adaptive Testing (C AT) is a growing mode of assessment in many educational
as well as non educational institutions around the world. A distinct feature
of CAT is its ability to tailor the test to the ability level of a test taker based on
the observed responses to previously administered items. Hence, shorter tests can be
administered and yet more accurate estimates can be attained. In the literature, several
approaches have been proposed for making C AT systems based on Item Response
Theory (IRT) and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs). Along with other detriments,
these approaches rely on strict assumptions and require a large amount of probability
data. In this thesis, we survey the state of the art of computerized adaptive testing.
Then, we explore the application of several static neural network models in designing
traditional tests. A fter that, we propose a novel approach fo r making C A T systems
using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). A s a form of neural networks, R N N is
data driven and self adaptive classifier. Moreover, being recurrent, it captures the system
dynamics by remembering the time varying pattern of examinee’s responses to
previously administered items. We developed a toolkit of C AT system based on RNNs
in Matlab 1.0 and evaluated its performance on several datasets. The results of the
proposed approach are found to be promising as compared to some existing techniques.
