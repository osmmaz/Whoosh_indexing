This thesis presents a structured methodology to
help contractors working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
to make their bid/no bid decision on a rational basis.
Literature was reviewed and thirty seven factors that
affect the contractors bid/no bid decision were found.
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used as a
decision support model. Computer software named Expert
Choice, based on the AHP and the bid/no bid decision
factors, was used to develop and solve the bid/no bid
decision model. A real life example was used to
demonstrate the application of the model and to help one
of the major contractors in the eastern province to
ensure the rationality of his decision to bid for a
project in the Riyadh area.
