Large funds are expended on domestic water supply projects; however,
lack of appropriate conceptual cost estimating techniques causes difficulties
such as project delays and cost overruns. This thesis presents a structured and
systematic procedure for the implementation of a Computerized Conceptual
Cost Estimating System (CCES) for Domestic Water Supply Projects. CCES
has been designed to produce cost estimates at the conceptual stage when only
a little information is available about the project.
The research began with the identification of the factors influencing the
costs of pipeline, reservoir, and pumping station projects. Next, historical cost
data of commissioned projects were gathered from tender documents and
subsequent regression analysis was carried out. The regression analysis was
computer based which facilitated a "what if' analysis during the model
creation course and helped examine the adequacy of the cost factors.
Moreover, the adequacies of the cost models were checked and found to comply with the standards of the American Society of Cost Engineers. Finally,
the cost models were integrated into a user friendly application software.
This thesis demonstrated that a well thought out integration among the
science of cost estimation, statistical analysis, and computer technology
enhances the practices of cost estimating. Although the research focused on the
Sultanate of Oman as a case study, the methodology set forth is relevant to the
construction and water industries in general, particularly in the Arabian Gulf
countries.
