The accelerating pace of die information technology and the growing size and
power of both computer systems and software make die use of computers in many
industries essential. This study investigates the use of computers by large,
medium, and small sized contractors in Saudi Arabia. The main objectives of this
study is to investigate the type and the extent of computer use among contractors,
to reveal the areas and functions of contractors that are computerized, and to
investigate the factors that are responsible for the observed extent of use.
A questionnaire was developed and mailed to 300 construction contractors all
over Saudi Arabia. These contractors were selected randomly from a list of
classified contractors. Ninety three contractors participated in the study.
The results show that only 55 percent of all contractors are using computers,
mainly microcomputers, in their firms. However, it was found that as the size of
the firms get bigger, the percent of users increases. All large sized contractors,
sixty two percent of medium sized contractors, and only 41 percent of small sized
contractors are using computers in their business operations.
The results show that accounting process is widely computerized among those who
use computers. The creation o f databases is the second function that computers are
used for in construction firms. Contractors use computers widely for word
processing.
The results indicate that lack of computer experience and difficulty in selecting the
appropriate computer systems are heavily ranked as factors hindering the use of
computer technology by construction contractors, especially small and medium
sized contractors.
