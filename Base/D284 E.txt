company management must come up with the best decisions during the

determining the consistency o f the decision maker. Additionally, a survey has
been conducted to gather information about the criteria that influence the
decisions for ranking and evaluating telecommunications projects alternatives.

participate in this survey. To demonstrate the usefulness and application of the
model, it has been applied on a telecommunications project for a major
industrial company using the criteria that resulted from the questionnaires
