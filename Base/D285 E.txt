Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) is the process of teaching by computer. Computerbased
educational systems are valuable tools to improve learning. It is thus worth
endowing programming environments with educational capabilities to help students learn
programming. Computer Programming is a typical introductory computer science course
that is offered to all science and engineering students in an academic environment. The
amount of attention traditionally paid to the syntax of a programming language in the first
course is excessive, and ought to be replaced with a more balanced introduction to the
discipline. Program development process has three distinct phases: understand the
problem, design the solution, and code the program. Much of the creativity in
programming is concentrated in designing the solution rather than implementing it in a
selected language. We have developed a model, called Computer Aided Programming
Education (CAPE), that supports the program development process. CAPE consists of
problem definition and algorithm construction modules. Algorithm construction module is
currently supported with a facility to map an algorithm(s) into FORTRAN or Pascal code.
CAPE motivates students to study the algorithmic problems operationally and provides a
mechanism for rapid prototyping in various programming languages.
