As the public sector considers engaging consultants (A/Es) for professional services,
many factors participate in making A/E selection process much inconsistent and complicated.
Therefore, the public sector is in need for a consistent, comprehensive and flexible methodology
that will ensure successful selection of A/E. This research is directed toward the improvement
of the A/E selection process in Saudi Arabia.
Thirty public sector organizations and thirty consultants were surveyed to identify the
major selection criteria of A/E. As a result, Work Experience, Project Management, Capability,
Staff and Qualification, Quality Performance, Past Performance, Quality Control, References
and Firm Capacity were identified to be the major selection criteria. They were used in
conjunction with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) theory concept and a computerized
software program “Expert Choice” based on AHP in structuring the A/E consultant conceptual
selection model (CCSM). The CCSM was used for solving the selection problem. As results,
the (CCSM) model is proved to be practical, complete and flexible enough to meet public
sector demand to incorporate any additional criteria.
