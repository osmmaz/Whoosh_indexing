Laser heating finds wide application in industry due to its precision of operation and
local treatment. Since the laser machining is involved in complex physical processes,
the modeling of laser induced heating gives insight into the physical processes involved.
Moreover, model studies reduce experimental cost and provided parametric data for
heating optimization.
Laser non conduction limited heating is involved with phase change processes, i.e.
melting and subsequent evaporation. Depending upon the laser pulse intensity and
the profile, partial melting or partial evaporation can take place in the substrate
material irradiated by a laser beam. The region where partied phase change occur
can be identified as a mushy zone in the substrate material. When modeling the
non conduction heating process, mushy zone should be taken into account. In the
present study, pulse laser heating o f metallic substrate is considered. The governing
equations of heat transport pertinent to conduction and phase change processes are
presented. Since, the heating model is involved with a two dimensional axisymmetric
heating, analytical solution to the problem is almost impossible; consequently, a
numerical scheme employing a control volume approach is introduced to solve the
governing equations o f heat transfer. The thermal stress fields in the region irradiated
by a laser beam is modeled and transient behavior of stresses are obtained.
