In this dissertation, the design of configurable analog blocks for field programmable
analog arrays is presented. The configurable blocks are capable of performing
integration, differentiation, amplification, log, and anti log functions. The realization of
these functions depends on differential continuous time current mode translinear loop
techniques. To maintain high frequency operation, programmability and configurability
o f the blocks are achieved by modifying the block’s bias conditions digitally. The
analog signal processing part of the blocks is designed using BJTs. To get compatibility
with digital, the controlling parts of the blocks are designed using CMOS. Simulation
results for the presented circuits and for examples of analog signal processing systems
formed using them are also introduced.
