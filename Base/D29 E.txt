Translation Service Providers (TSP) play a major role in Qatar by providing translation
and interpreting services for different sectors. It is necessary to provide these services in
an organized, systematic, and consistent fashion in order to have a strong and
competitive market and also to maintain internationally recognized confidentiality
standards. This empirical research will explore the situation of the translation market in
Qatar from the point of view of confidentiality. In my semi structured interviews and the
data analysis process, I followed the methods of Bernard (2011) and Bernard, Wutich
and Ryan (2016), as well as that of Harrell and Bradley (2009) based on the adopted
models of Arksey, Hillary and Knight (1999). These models constitute the theoretical
framework for this research. After I collected the required data, I analyzed it against ISO
17100 confidentiality standard to determine whether the TSPs comply with the
confidentiality standard or not. After I identified deficiencies, I proposed a set of
possible solutions that could contribute to resolving them and enhance the translation
market in Qatar and the level of confidentiality.
