Congestion management in transmission network utilizing STATCOM incorporation
in transmission network is presented. Transmission congestion management problem
is studied from different aspects, i.e. congestion relief, location marginal price
reduction, congestion costs and cost recovery period are carried out. Genetic
Algorithm as an intelligent optimization technique is considered to obtain the
optimum STATCOM location and rating to be incorporated in the transmission grid.
Comparisons with similar results reported in literature are demonstrated. The
effectiveness of STATCOM installation in a congested transmission network to
enhance power flow parameters and to maintain location marginal prices at
acceptable levels is verified
