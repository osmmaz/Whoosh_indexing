Conjugate laminar forced convection heat transfer in the entry region o f eccentric
annuli is numerically investigated. Heat transfer •parameters are presented for a
fluid o f Pr=0.7 flowing in an annulus of radius ratio 0.5 fo r four values of dimensionless
eccentricity ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. Solid fluid conductivity ratio (KR) is
varied to cover the range fo r practical cases with commonly encountered inner and
outer tube thicknesses. Lim its for KR above which the conjugation can be neglected
are obtained. For solid fluid conductivity ratio (KR) equal to 10, the inner and
outer tube thicknesses are varied to obtain the limits of wall thickness below which
the conjugation can be neglected. Boundary conditions applied are isothermal heating
o f the inner surface o f the core tube while the outer surface o f the external tube is
maintained at the inlet fluid temperature. Results indicate that the conjugate effect
is significant fo r systems with low values of KR and thick walled tubes. Moreover,
this effect increases with invreasing the eccentricity (E) and thus conjugation must
be taken into consideration particularly at high values o f E.
