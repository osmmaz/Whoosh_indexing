This study analyzes and discusses the diagnostic evaluation process and the repair works
performed to strengthen a tubular reinforced concrete pier against torsional stresses. This
pier, which carries a rotary kiln, manifested cracking and spalling at its platform /wall joint
and diagonal shear cracking on the wall surfaces as a result o f these stresses. The
strengthening system utilized consists of casting a reinforced 240 mm thick SF shotcrete
jacket around the exterior of the structure, in addition to the use o f epoxy bonded steel plates
to further reinforce the deteriorated platform/wall joint. This system was evaluated 30
months after its completion, during which the kiln was subjected to several cycles o f firing
and shutdowns. No defects resulting from torsional stresses were found. Description and
results of the repair evaluation tests, as well as other tests carried out to verify the validity
of several hypotheses related to the works performed, are also presented and dicussed.
