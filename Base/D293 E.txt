The design of a concrete mix is a complex procedure. It
depends on many factors such as properties of materials
,method of preparation , compaction , placement and curing
of concrete , as well as the requirements of a construction
job such as workability and durability. Once these factors
are specified, the remaining task involves proportioning of
the quantities of materials. This is usually carried out in
terms of determining the water cement ratio, aggregatecement
ratio or cement content, and sand to total aggregate
ratio for particular gradations of aggregates and maximum
size of coarse aggregate. This procedure becomes more
difficult to achieve for an optimum mix design in hot
weather conditions.
In order to develop a suitable method for concrete mix
design in hot weather, the effects of the following factors
were considered : (i) water cement ratio, (i i) total
aggregate to cement ratio, (iii) sand to total aggregate
ratio and (iv) concrete mix temperature at placement in
conjunction with field conditions for curing in hot weather.
