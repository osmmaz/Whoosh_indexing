Conjugate laminar fi'ee convection heat transfer in vertical eccentric annuli is
numerically investigated. Heat transfer parameters such as temperature, heat flux and
bulk m can temperature have been numerically o btained f or a fluid of Prandtl n umber,
Pr=0.7 in the eccentric annulus at dt’fl'erent values of eccentricity, radius ratio, wall
thickness and conductivity ratio. In addition to these parameters, the efi'ect of conductivigr
ratio, eccentricity, wall thickness and radius ratio on channel height, required to induce
specific/low rate, has also been investigated. The analysis has been carried out for two
difl'erent pairs of thermal boundary conditions. One pair of boundary conditions
comprises of one wall kept isothermal at inlet fluid temperature while the other wall
heated isothermally whereas the other pair of boundary conditions consists of one wall
kept adiabatic while the other wall heated isothermally. Furthermore, results of the
present study are utilisedfir the first pair of boundary conditions to establish the limits.
namely the critical values, for solid fluid conductivity ratio, above which, and wall
thickness, below which, the conjugate eflect can be neglected for various eccentricity and
radius ratio values. Also. jbr the second pair of boundary conditions, the optimum values
ofsoIid fluid conductivity ratio and wall thickness. giving the maximum induced flow rate
for a given channel height, have been obtained for various radius ratio and eccentricigr
values.
