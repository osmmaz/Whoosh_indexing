The problem of combined conduction with natural convection heat transfer in
vertical concentric annuli has been investigated numerically using an implicit finitedifference
scheme. Both the transient and steady state heat transfer have been considered
in this investigation. The effects of the three main controlling parameters, namely,
modified Grashof Number (Gr*), thermal conductivity ratio (KR) and thermal diffusivity
ratio ( c x r ) have been presented over wide ranges of these parameters. The study showed
that K r and a R have prominent effects on the flow characteristics as well as on the heat
transfer. Moreover, at the values of KR =100 and a R =1000 the conduction effect on the
heat transfer becomes negligible and for such values the results of the conventional case
can be used with an acceptable accuracy.
