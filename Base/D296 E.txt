This thesis studies the methods followed by the building
construction contractors in the Eastern Province of Saudi
Arabia to control the project cost as well as the factors
that affect the level of control exerted during construction.
This study was conducted by series of structured
interviews with forty five randomly selected contractors.
Results of this study were post stratified according to the
five contractors grades specified by the Agency of Classification
of Contractors in Riyadh.
It was found that the contractors in the Eastern Province
follow a basic logic sequence in cost control. First, they
start by setting the required budget as follows: A) Project
estimates are either very general and simple or based on
unrealistic assumptions. B) Soil reports form the main
source of site analysis. C) Work breakdown structure is
based on standard item headings predefined at head office.
D) Contractors are  unfamiliar with the concept of cost
codes. E) A period between 1 4 weeks is most common for
short term planning. Second, they measure and report actual
costs as follows: A) Charging resources hours is based on
personal observations. B) Purchase orders and invoices are
mainly used to charge material consumed. C) Systematic procedures
for site feedback are lacking. D) Monthly cost
statements are the most common tool for cost status reporting.
Third, cost variance testing is based on comparing the
budgeted vs. the actual cost of work done to date. Finally,
the cause(s) of cost variance is investigated by informal
methods and incentives form  the most popular corrective
action. Regarding the factors that affect the level of control,
Company Characteristics, Project Characteristics and
Project Documents are the most influential. On the other
hand, Company Characteristics is the most discriminating
factor among the five contractors grades.
