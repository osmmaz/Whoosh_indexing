The thesis discusses the effects of faulty design and construction factors on
maintenance. A survey o f 90 construction and maintenance contractors, 30
designers and 20 owners was conducted.
The survey included 67 different faulty factors and their degree o f
importance. The severity factors o f these factors were measured by their level o f
importance and were ranked according to the severity index for the combination o f
all respondents, contractors, consultants and owners.
The severity o f the faulty factors were analyzed statistically using the SAS
mainframe computer package. These defect factors were obtained from interviews
and discussions with contractors, consultants and owners.
The research includes a hypothesis that "contractors, consultants and
owners generally agree on the ranking of severity indices" which was tested and
shown to hold true. It was concluded that Inadequate Structural Design ,
Unqualified Staff , Wrong Selection of Material, and Non Compliance with
Specification, are the most severe factors. Also, it was noted that contractors gave
the most actual responses, followed by consultants then the owner. This reflects
their true involvement and awareness of faulty factors that increase maintenance.
Finally, in order to minimize maintenance defects and expenditure, a set o f
recommendations are made and topics for future research are suggested.
