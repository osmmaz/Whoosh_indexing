This thesis studied the construction financial system in Saudi
Arabia. This system has changed drastically in the last five years
due to a volatile construction market industry, characterized by
low margins, intense competition, and liquidity problems.

Contractor's financing system (sources and requirements) is
examined in this study. This financial system was studied from
three sources: literature review, meetings with five Saudi commer 
cial banks, and from conducting a survey of twenty contractors,
with different clalssifications and with an average annual volume of
work of more than SR:30 million.
