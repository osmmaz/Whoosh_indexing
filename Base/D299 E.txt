Research has shown that for many projects, up to 95  of the total project cost is spent on
the execution of the construction phase. Hence, the costs incurred during this stage
deserve special attention in terms of cost dynamics i.e., cost allocation in relation to time.
Owners with numerous projects need to estimate the amount of money to be paid to
contractors over the entire period of the project implementation. Due to the overlapping
execution of these multiple projects, the owners are faced with the problem of estimating
periodic payments as well as the entire budget to ensure that sufficient and timely funds
are available for all their ventures. This write up reports on a study aimed at identifying
good cash flow forecasting techniques for construction projects. The method reported
here incorporates historical trend based data for projects with similar traits and provides
an output that can be used by a decision maker to exercise his competent judgments
based on the decision maker’s construction experience and knowledge. The approach is
explored using financial information from an owner organization in Saudi Arabia
executing numerous projects
