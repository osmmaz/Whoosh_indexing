The study of evaluative positioning and its linguistic manifestations across a variety
of discourses has recently garnered much interest, with many scholars and
researchers exploring the field, developing related analytical frameworks and
subjecting them to practice and critique (Martin and White 2005, Thompson and
Alba Juez 2014, Bednarek 2008 and 2009, Bolivar 2001, Lemke 1998, and many
others). A closer look at the evaluative function of language in contemporary Arabic
translation theory reveals that it is underrepresented. The present thesis aims to
react to this reality by producing a functionally adequate Arabic translation of an
insightful theoretical framework of evaluation as applied to Translation Studies, with
a view to making it available to Arabic Translation Studies, and addressing a gap in
Arabic metalinguistic terminology by creating its Arabic terms. Adopting a
functionalist translation approach (Nord 1997, Reiss and Vermeer 1984/2014), I will
translate into Arabic a part of the second chapter in Munday's Evaluation in
Translation: Critical Points of Translator Decision Making (2012) where he applies to
Translation Studies the Appraisal Framework developed by Martin and White
through the analysis of Obama's 2009 inaugural address and three different Spanish
renderings through interpretation. The critical commentary will then look into
terminology and term creation as a first problem area where issues such as termconcept
stability, term overlap, synonymy and ambiguity are expected to arise (Rey
1995, Cabré 1999). A second problem area will involve issues that may be
encountered while translating illustrative examples furnished by Munday to show how evaluation operates in decisions taken by Spanish interpreters, such as backtranslation,
gloss, and the degree of translator intervention. Finally, the applicability
of the Arabic terms of the Appraisal Framework to an Arabic context will be tested
through analyzing the official Arabic version of Obama's address produced by the US
Department of State.
