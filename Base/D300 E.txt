Multimedia distribution over the Internet has emerged as a popular
application. However, delivering multimedia content poses many non trivial
challenges such as fulfilling Quality o f Service (QoS) requirements. This
thesis focuses on how to improve QoS o f multimedia traffic over Enterprise
Data Networks (EDNs) using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). The
reason fo r choosing MPLS is its support fo r traffic engineering (TE) and
QoS provisioning. A novel content aware congestion control algorithm is
designed, implemented and tested. The proposed scheme enables the MPLS
router to discard packets with less important content when there is
congestion in the network. By employing such content aware congestion
control, the overall quality o f multimedia content is not significantly affected,
enabling graceful degradation o f quality using a Wavelet based compression
technique. The proposed scheme is modeled and simulated using the J Sim
network simulator and implemented in an extended public domain Linuxbased
MPLS router. Simulation and measurement based testing shows that
the proposed scheme maintains low delay, low jitter, and packet loss o f
multimedia traffic, even under high network congestion when compared with
standard MPLS and IP QoS architecture   DiffServ. This thesis contributes a
novel scheme to the existing MPLS architecture to improve QoS o f Wavelet
based compressed multimedia data.
