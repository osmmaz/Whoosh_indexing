A servomechanism is a system that controls the position or velocity of a mechanical
devise. In many applications, such as disk drive head positioning and pick and place robots, it
is desirable to have servomechanisms effect a minimum time response. Since there is a limit
on the magnitude of the control signal in every control system, this leads to time optimal
controllers that are bang bang. Truly bang bang time optimal control systems are not
practical, due to the poor overall behavior such as the instantaneous switching and the limit
cycles about the target state. In order to eliminate such undesirable behavior, we apply
Continuous Proximate Time Optimal (CPTO) controller to a third order servomechanism
having three real roots, which represents our modeling of the hard disk drive servomechanism.
We have shown that the CPTO controller gives near time optimal response for large states,
and provides smooth and stable response with near linear control for small states.
To overcome the mathematical difficulties of solving the time optimal control problem
of the model of the plant, new approach based on similarity transformation has been used.
A saturated linear state feedback controller has been designed for comparison and
assessment.
It has been shown through the simulation results that response times are indeed near
time optimal. Moreover, it has been shown though specific examples that the CPTO behaves
well in the presence of certain unmodeled dynamics, also it behaves well in the presence of a
plant parameter variation providing that the control law is based on the worst case
consideration.
A comparison of the performance of the CPTO controller when changing the design
criterion of the linear gain constants has been made.
