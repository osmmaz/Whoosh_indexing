This thesis presents a structured and systematic
approach that will help public owners in Bahrain to perform
the process of contractor prequalification. The research
began with an analysis of the contractor prequalification
process as it is currently practised in general by the
construction industry. This analysis is based on a review
of the literature and formal interviews with public
officials responsible for construction projects. In the
second phase, a questionnaire was distributed to gather data
on t h o s e d e c i s i o n criteria which influence this
decision making process. Quantitative and qualitative
statistical analyses of these data were performed.
