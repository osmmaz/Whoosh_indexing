Distributed control system comprises many nodes (i.e., controllers, sensors, and
actuators), which are interconnected with communication networks. The control
networks in industry have evolved from dedicated communication links to distributed
communication links over shared data networks. Typically, the control and
communication systems in a distributed networked industrial system are based on
periodic sampling. This may result in excessive use of communication and computational
resources causing high network traffic. The increased network traffic
can cause delay, packet drop, and network congestion problems which affect the
performance and stability of control loops over the network. This thesis proposes
an event based solution to reduce the network traffic and to avoid the delay, and
packet drop in the context of distributed networked control systems.
