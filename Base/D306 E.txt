The topic of this thesis is control and estimation over unreliable communication networks such as wireless network. It is assumed that the plant and control unit are connected though unreliable channels. We considered the problems of estimation and control under two dierent protocols. In the TCP like rotocol, where the control unit provides acknowledgments successfully delivered of the packets, while the acknowledgments are absent in case of UDP like protocol. This thesis investigates techniques for designing linear quadratic Gaussian LQG controller and estimation schemes subject to packet dropout using state and output feedback. Firstly, LQG optimal controller is designed using optimal theory based on Linear quadratic regulator and a discrete Kalman  lter with packet dropout according to Bernoulli process. Necessary and su cient conditions to guaranty stability are stated. Then estimation schemes are elaborated for a class of networked control system with nonstationary data lost. Two observer based stabilizing controller of networked control systems (NCSs) are designed in case of zero input and hold input strategies. Su cient conditions for stability are derived in terms of using linear matrix inequality (LMIs). Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented using MATLAB software for several numerical examples.
