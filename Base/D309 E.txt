Nano films consisting o f an alternating sequence of positively and negatively
charged polyelectrolytes have been prepared by means o f the electrostatic layer by layer
sequential assembly technique on treated and untreated mild steel wires. The mild steel
wires were pretreated electrochemically to modify the mild steel surface. The
modification o f the mild steel surface resulted in increasing the adhesion o f the obtained
nano films and prevented the corrosion attack during the coating processes. Different
concentrations o f 2 phosphonobutane 1,2,4 tricarboxilic acid and Benzotriazole
inhibitors were encapsulated between cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes nano films.
The encapsulation o f benzotriazoe in the deposited nano films was verified by U.V
visible spectroscopy. The thesis mainly focuses on the effect o f these nano films of
polyelectrolytes with different functional groups on the corrosion protection. Tafel,
corrosion potential, potentiostatic and E corr vs. time experiments were carried out in 0.7M
NaCl solution. Weight loss method was used for measuring the corrosion rate of coated
and uncoated mild steel substrate. A significant improvement in the corrosion protection
was achieved especially in the case o f electrochemically modifying the mild steel surface
and encapsulating the inhibitors between the polyelectrolyts nano films. The atomic force
microscopy AFM was used for monitoring the surface morphology o f the obtainednano
films.
