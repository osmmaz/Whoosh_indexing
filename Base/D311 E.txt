Poor quality and high risk have been associated with the image of construction industry for a long
time. The existence of legal contracts is no guarantee that the client will ultimately be satisfied with
his completed construction project The demand is now increasing that construction contractors
have to have in house effective quality systems that can give the clients the confidence or
assurance that they will get quality constructed projects on their lands.
This research provides a summary of an assessment of the quality systems of fifteen major
construction contractors in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, evaluated against ISO 9000
standard. The study revealed that the contractors quality systems vary in complexity ranging from
informal inspection and test system to a comprehensive system where inspection and testing is
only one element among many others. The study revealed that two contractors from the case
studies have been already certified by third party to ISO 9002, and four others are in the process
of being certified. Four contractors have long term plans to fully implement quality systems that
meet ISO 9000 standard while three contractors are not familiar with the standard. The study
disclosed that “Handling, Storage and Preservation”, “Contract Review” and “Inspection and Test”
are the clauses of ISO 9000 standard that the selected contractors most often comply with, while
“Internal Auditing”, “Design Control”, “Statistical Techniques:, “Corrective and Preventive Action”
and “Management Review" are the least. Documentation of the quality system lacking by the
majority of the contractors.
