Cooperative multi input multi output (MIMO) schemes in wireless communication systems
improve coverage, throughput, capacity, and quality of service. We propose to evaluate
the performance of uplink cooperative MIMO using hopping over MIMO relays. Both simulations
and analysis are performed to evaluate the proposed system in terms of several
physical parameters such as distance, modulation type, number of relays, and number of
hops.
We derive the analytical error performance for virtual MIMO relaying schemes using
the V BLAST amplify and forward scheme (AF) and detect split and forward scheme
(DSF). The performance of the non orthogonal virtual MIMO systems for both nonorthogonal
spacetime block code (STBC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) are studied.
We introduce and analyze the performance of relayed spatial modulation, by deriving
expression for the average capacity and the probability of symbol error rate. The main contribution of this thesis is to provide analytical tools to evaluate the performance of distributed
and virtual MIMO relaying schemes, including V BLAST, STBC and spatial modulation.
