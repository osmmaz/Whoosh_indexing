This study casts light on the heal transfer in asymmetrically healed packed ducts
in which a constant heat flux is supplied from the lop while the other walls are insulated.
Two different ducts with aspect ratio W/H o f 8 and 4 respectively have been used. Two
different types o f packing have been used. The first one is the expanded polystyrene
sphere in three different sizes while the second one is the polyvinyl chloride Raschig ring
in two different sizes. Both air and wall temperatures were measured at various positions
fo r different air flow rates and different heat fluxes. This was done fo r both empty and
packed ducts.
This study presents both experimental and numerical analysis fo r the steady stale
case. The effect o f both type and size ofpacking in addition to the aspect ratio o f the duct
on the heat transfer coefficient has been studied. A comparison between the measured
and predicted values o f air temperatures is shown. This study gives a correlation fo r
Nusselt number that can he used for 96 < Re,,< 5755 and 4.5 < dLJdp < 9 and duct to
separation ratio L/H= 16.
