Environmental pollution is a major problem facing us today. The rapid growth and the
applications o f advanced production technology resulted in high metal contaminants in
wastewater streams. This study is concerned with removing toxic heavy metal ions
(copper ions) from industrial wastewater prior to its discharge to the waste streams.
In this project, copper ion concentration in a wastewater was reduced from one
hundred parts per million (ppm) to less than one part per million and the copper ions were
recovered in their metallic form by electrodeposition at the cathode of an electrochemical
cell. An oblique rotating barrel, which was partially filled with copper raschig rings, was
used as the cathode. The rotating barrel offers a high mass transfer rate and a large
cathode surface area for copper electrodeposition.
This thesis presents the experimental measurements o f the apparent reaction rate
constant of copper deposition reaction at different operation variables. These variables
include; cell voltage, barrel rotation speed, percent barrel loading, percent barrel
immersion, barrel tilt angle, and anode surface area. The experimental results showed that
rate o f copper deposition reaction inside the rotating barrel was mass transfer and
kinetically controlled. With an operating cell voltage of 2.5 to 5.0 V, the overall current
efficiency for copper recovery was 20 to 53  , and the electric energy requirement was in
the range of 4 to 21 kWh per kilogram of copper recovered from the wastewater. These
results indicate that the present electrolytic process is economically feasible for large scale
industrial wastewater treatment operations.
