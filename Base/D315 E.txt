With the increasing accessibility of high performance computing power to engineers
in the recent years, we need methods to utilize this power to help in the generation
of optimal industrial designs. For this purpose, a constructal algorithm has been
implemented. Constructal theory is a new way of searching for the optimum geometry
of a flow system. The constructal principle says that the form of a system is a
result of a struggle for better performance amongst the existence of constraints on
the system. Different systems need different constructal configuration searches based
on their performance objectives and constraints. In this work, the numerical optimization
method called the Coordinate Search Method has been made use of in order
to perform the constructal configuration search to find the optimal heat conducting
channel design on a disc. This work serves as the first step in the development of
a General Constructal Designer Tool where the input to the tool will be the description
of the flow system and the tool will find the optimal flow configurations for the
system. This interdisciplinary work makes use of the Coordinate Search Method,
Constructal Theory, and Heat Transfer concepts.
