Inhibition o f atm ospheric corrosion of mild steel in the Arabian G u lf region was
investigated in this study. A fter searching the literature and the m arket ten chem icals were
obtained to be tested by electrochemical techniques in a simulated solution o f 2  NaCl
and 1  N a2 S0 4 in the laboratory as corrosion inhibitors o f mild steel. A m ong the
chem icals screened sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, dicyclohexylam ine nitrite and
sodium benzoate were selected for further investigation under atm ospheric and
accelerated laboratory conditions. Application conditions o f the selected inhibitors, such
as the tem perature o f steel specim ens before immersion in the inhibitor solution and
concentration o f the inhibitor solution were also investigated by electrochem ical
techniques in the simulated solution. Room tem perature was found to be the best
application tem perature for the three inhibitors. Effective concentrations for sodium
dihydrogen orthophosphate, dicyclohexylamine nitrite and sodium benzoate were
determ ined to be 10, 100 and 100 mM, respectively.
