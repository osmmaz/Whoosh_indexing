This study attempts to formulate and quantify various relevant considerations
which influence the effective cathodic protection of corroding reinforcing
steel in concrete structures in the Gulf environment. The parameters included in
the research program are: chloride content, temperature, reactive aggregates,
depth o f reinforcement in a two mat system and secondary effects. It was found
that the instant off, shift and decay potentials as well as the current density
needed for adequate protection of steel are dependent on the chloride gradient as
well as the chloride content in concrete. A 60°C exposure required only about
2 0 percent higher level of protection in terms of current density/instant off potential/
decay potential for an initial polarization period of two months. Enhanced
activation in the initial period reduces the corrosion activity subsequently due to
the beneficial electromigration of ions requiring a reduced protection on a long
term basis. The decay potential criterion was found to be least sensitive to chloride
content, chloride gradient and temperature effect, although it does not
explicitly indicate the level of protection current which is automatically adjusted
to accommodate the various factors influencing corrosion activity
