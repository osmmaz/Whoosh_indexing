The target of this research is to assist designers in understanding the cost implication of
design variables, so that they can make more objective design decisions and offer more
objective cost advice for the benefits of their clients. This research was focused to
achieve two major targets. After thorough review of relevant literature in order to gain
insight into the research theme, the first target was to investigate the procedures adopted
by A/E firms in accounting for design variables in the early cost estimates they prepare for
residential buildings. This was achieved through the administration of questionnaire.
Nineteen (19) firms working in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia participated in the
survey. The survey results revealed that most of the A/E firms do not utilize specialized
software packages in carrying out cost estimating services. Also, the firms neither utilize
any systematic procedures in accounting for design variables nor the models developed by
construction researchers. The second target was concerned with the empirical study of the
effects of architectural design variables on the cost of residential building in a series of
simulation experiments. The design variables that were studied include Plan shape, Size,
Average s torey h eight, an d n umber o f s toreys. An e mpirical c ost estimate m odel o f a
“typical Saudi Arabian villa” was prepared and used for the simulation. The effects of the
other factors on construction cost were held constant during the simulation runs and
conclusions to a number of hypotheses formulated, among other things, were sought from
the results of the simulation runs.
Similar studies have been recommended for other project types (such as Industrial and
Commercial buildings), and on Design Build contractors and estimating personnel
working in relevant Government agencies.
