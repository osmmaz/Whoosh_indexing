In this thesis, the second generation current conveyor (CCU) is used in realizing new
active RC, active R and active C multiphase sinusoidal oscillators (MPSOs) and unity
gain cell based universal filters. Also, taking advantage o f the parasitic resistance Rx
which appears at the port X o f the CCII, a new programmable active C current mode
universal filter is presented. In order to be compatible with integration requirements,
these circuits use minimum number o f active and passive elements, enjoy independent
control o f the critical circuit parameters, use grounded capacitors and enjoy low active
and passive sensitivities. The effects o f parasitics, voltage and current tracking errors
of the CCII, on the circuit parameters are discussed. Extending the use o f current
conveyor to nonlinear applications is investigated and a simple current mode analog
multiplier/divider circuit using only two CCCII is presented. Comparisons between all
o f the proposed circuits and the previously published circuits are included.
