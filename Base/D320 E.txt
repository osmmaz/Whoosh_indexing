Several aspects o f [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions of tcrt butylcyanokctene
(TBCK) with different kctcnophiles have been studied. Cvcoaddition of mono
substituted alkenes having tert butyldimcthylsiloxy group attached to nonalkenic
carbon has been found to undergo rcgio  and stereo selective addition
to TBCK to give contratherm odynam ic product as the sole adduct. However
addition to styrene and p mcthoxy styrene was found to be non selectivc and
a mixture of adducts were formed in each case. A way has been found to
convert the contrathermodynamic adduct to the thermodynamic product.
Addition reaction of TBCK with 1,1 disubstituted alkenes having tbutyldimcthylsiloxy,
or benzyloxy group attached to allylic or homoallylic
positions afforded a mixture of cyclobutanoncs in addition to acyclic product
arising out of ene reaction.
