This thesis presents a new production scheme to produce high water cut wells from
mature oil fields called Cyclic Production Scheme. This scheme is applied as a first field
trail in the world in one of Saudi Aramco mature oil fields. The field trial under Cyclic
Production Scheme is illustrated thoroughly in this paper.
A conceptual simulation model using ECLIPSE is built to assess reservoir performance
under the Cyclic Production Scheme. Three simulation models are considered:
Homogenous, Layered and Heterogeneous. The simulation results show commonly the
advantages of Cyclic Production Scheme over regular production as follows:
1. Significant reduction in cumulative water production up to 50 .
2. Slight improvement in cumulative oil production up to 5 .
3. Slight reduction in cumulative water injection up to 6 .
4. Small increase in average reservoir pressure by about 70 psi.
