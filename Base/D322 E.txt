A study of the regiochemical and stereochemical behavior of the addition
reaction of a heterocyclic nitrone. 5.6 dihydro l ,4 oxazine 4 oxide with a series
of alkenes has been carried out The high degree of regiochemical control in these
concerted reactions has been explained in terms of frontier molecular orbital
treatment. Stereoselectivity in these cycloaaditions has been explained in terms
of steric factors and secondary orbital interactions.
Rate constants for the cycloaddition of the heterocyclic nitrone with
several alkenes have been determined at 36°C by *H NMR spectroscopy.
Differences in the rates of cycloadditions have been explained in terms of
combination of various factors such as torsional strain, bond angle bending strain,
and steric factors (non bonded repulsion) in the transition state.
