The piperazine moiety, having two amine functional groups, was
used as starting material to synthesize quaternary piperazinium salts
having two allyl groups at one nitrogen, while the other nitrogen was
blocked as amide with form yl and long chain hydrophobic acyl groups.
The hom opolym erization o f the fo rm y l deriva tive and its
copolymerization with 1 10 mol  o f corresponding acyl compounds
were carried out in water using different free radical initiators. The
process o f polym erization was optim ized at d ifferen t reaction
conditions. Rheological behaviour o f aqueous solutions o f the above
homopolymer and copolym er was studied. The incorporation o f
hydrophobic group in the copolymer chains was fo u n d to increase the
viscosity o f the aqueous solution. Addition o f salt (NaCl) to the aqueous
polymer solution exhibited the typical behaviour o f poly electrolytes.
Copolymerization o f sulfur dioxide and the form yl piperazinium salt
was also carried out.
Anion exchange resins were prepared by copolymerizing tetraallylpiperazinium
dichloride (cross linker) with the diallyl derivative and
swelling coefficient was determined fo r these resins
