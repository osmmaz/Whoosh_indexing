A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is a shunt connected FACTS device,
which is capable o f enhancing the power system damping by exchanging reactive power
with the system. In this thesis, robust STATCOM controls have been investigated fo r
power system damping improvement. Non linear and linear models o f a single machine
infinite bus (SMIB) system as well as multimachine systems installed with STATCOM
have been derived. The method o f multiplicative uncertainty has been employed in the
robust design to model the variations o f the operating points. A graphical method termed
as loop shaping is used to select a suitable open loop transfer function from which the
robust controller is constructed. Improvement in the graphical method is proposed by
embedding a computational technique called the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in
the original loop shaping method. The high order multimachine models have been
simplified fo r control design through model reduction techniques. Linear and non linear
models o f both single machine as well as multimachine system have been simulated
including the PSO embedded robust controllers. A four machine test system is used to test
controllers considering small as well as large disturbances including three phase
symmetrical faults. Results indicate that the proposed robust design provides extremely
good damping over a wide range o f operating conditions.
