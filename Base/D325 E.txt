The use of wireless sensor networks in environmental monitoring applications has increased
rapidly. Due to the presence of extremely versatile as well as low cost devices in the market,
setting up a network now has become easy. A custom build wireless sensor node, named the
KFUPM node, has been successfully designed, implemented and tested with the network for
monitoring temperature and light. An expansion port for adding external sensors has been
provided to ease the need for sensing multiple phenomenon. Widely employed MAC protocol, SMAC,
has been implemented with unique algorithm which exhibits much better energy
conservation as compared to basic S MAC. A routing protocol based on cluster head rotation has
been designed and implemented. By employing a cluster head rotation policy, the new protocol
promises better energy consumption as compared to the existing protocols thus leading to the
enhancement of the overall network life. A network design utility has been created to provide
complete specifications for a network setup for a given network cost and an acceptable message
reception rate.
