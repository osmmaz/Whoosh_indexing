Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (D S/SS) systems offer several attractive features
which motivates growing research on code synchronization (involves both Code Acquisition
and Tracking) for SS systems as result of the crucial role that it plays in
operation of SS systems. This thesis introduces a modified adaptive filter structure
for Code Acquisition which is different from the one proposed earlier.
A n adaptive filter (AF) is used to carry the function of code acquisition. The taps
of the filter contains the results of the sum of a block o f chips. These contents are
then compared with the similar summation of the locally generated sequence. The
filter coefficients are adjusted towards their optimum value by using the Least Mean 
Square (XM Sj algorithm and the filter tap weights are used to estimate the delay
offset between the incoming SS signal and a locally generated P N sequence by m inimizing
the mean square error M SE between the received and the locally generated
sequences. This new method first locates the region or the cell in which the correct
phase lies and then the phase itself is acquired by zeroing onto the chip within the
cell identified.
The analysis of the system is done in A W G N environment for single user and theoretical
and simulation results are presented which shows that the system performance
is quite significant for low SN R conditions.
It is also shown that our modified scheme is robust to fading (frequency selective and
flat rayleigh fading) for low SN R environment. The adaptive nature of the system
is exploited to acquire and track the strongest received path.
Moreover, it has been shown that the proposed acquisition scheme significantly outperforms
conventional Matched Filter based acquisition schemes in the presence of
Multiple Access Interference (M AI).
