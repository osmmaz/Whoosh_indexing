The increasing use of Arabic in computers has led to the development of
Arabic programming languages. D H A D is an Arabic programming language
which falls into the class of structured languages such as Pascal. Porting the
D H A D compiler to popular computers (such as the V A X family of computers)
is needed to make the language available for Arabic software development,
research, and education.
The main objective of this research is to rewrite the code generator module
of the D H A D compiler for the V A X computers. The final code generator is the
module of the compiler that produces assembly language code from the
intermediate file taken as input. The work included a study of the final coclc
generator developed for a Z 80 based computer. The same algorithm for code
generation was used with some modifications. Code generated for the
operations on the various data structures (byte, word, integer, real, logical,
string, records, arrays, pointers and files) supported by D H A D has been
produced in V A X assembly language. Code for operations, including address
preparation of operands, branching, I/O operations, standard and'user defined
function and procedure call, definition and parameter preparation, has also been
implemented in V A X assembly language. Run time support library routines
were used for standard functions and procedures. In addition, some minor
modifications of the other modules (lexical and syntax analyzers) of the compiler
were imposed by the transportation of D H A D to the V AX. The final code
generator was implemented using Pascal on the V A X computer. The size of the
executable code of the code generation module was about 40 Kbytes.
