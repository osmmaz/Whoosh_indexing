A cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence is proposed. The
architecture is cognitive in the sense that fundamental cognitive hypotheses
served as guidelines for its design. It is termed self structuring because o f its
ability to autonomously extract and provide structure to what would
otherwise be considered unorganized data. In addition, it is considered a
connectionist machine in view o f its establishment on biological principles
and its distributed storage of data. The architecture is unique in that it
incorporates many o f the desirable features o f both symbolic and
connectionist systems, while being entirely based on proven biological and
psychological knowledge of the human brain, thereby providing a sound
foundation for future development. The architecture is exemplified by the
construction o f an artificial vision system based on the basic machine, and
the scope for further enhancement and development is outlined.
