Dynamic equivalents are reduced order differential equation models
of the dynamic characteristics of a power system. The reduced order model is
formed by lumping together group of power plant units (coherent group) which
tends to swing together for a given perturbation. Bach power plant unit is
represented as constituted by a synchronous machine, an excitation system, a
turbine. a governor and a boiler models. The equivalent units are made up of
similar models.
