This research aims to critically discover the role of Quran text in modernist
thinking of Adonis, which takes it importance from its provocation of the
relationships between Arab Modernity and the sacred/ Quran text from the
perspective of both the Arab and Western heritages, as presented in the critical
discourse of Adonis.
Quran text was a key constituentin Adonis's Theory of Modernity, whether in his
poetic innovation or critical discourse. His critical studies of Arab Modernity can
be used to prove that Quran text was both reflecting and tacit of most of these
studies, despite being used under specific names or concepts such as origin,
reference and destination in one hand or the unseen and the sacred in the other
hand.
Researching the representative origin in Quran text or its emerging religious
visionin Adonis's book "The Fixed and Variable at the Arabs" took two
consecutive chapters; the first and the second, in addition to being mentioned in a
number of critic studies such as "the Black Ocean", "Uncompleted Identity" and
"Music of the Blue Whale". We can also find it clearly and expressly mentioned in
other studies such as "Quran Text and Horizons of Writing".
Besides, it is used as an axis of a Sufi experience as presented in his book "Sufism
and Surrealism" and in his speech of Arab poetry in light of their historic and
miraculous union in the Arabic language, in addition to being the reference to
which all of his critical analyses return.
Despite the large number of critical studies on Adonis and his modernist project,
no one has ever exposed this main part of him. Most critics and researchers of
Adonis only researched two aspects; the first of which was the modernist poetry as
established by Adonis and the other was the critical methodology adopted by
Adonis in his critical discourse of Arab modernity. Therefore, this research was
made to study this ignored critical aspect of Adonis and his modernist discourse.
