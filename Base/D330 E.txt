As the Internet continues its explosive growth, the need for personalized searching tools to
access the Internet is increasing since famous search engines are built to serve all users,
independent of the needs of any individual user. In this thesis, we address the issue of
personalization of Internet search. A system has been designed, fully implemented and named
CAIA (Collaborative Autonomous Interface Agent). CAIA is developed to reside in the user’s
machine not in the Internet to make all private information on his/her machine. CAIA
supports communities of people in searching the Internet collaboratively by means of popular
search engines. CAIA leams the user’s preferences either explicitly or implicitly from his/her
browsing behavior. Those behaviors are based on a survey conducted earlier in this survey. It
then stores them along with the Websites' information in a User Profile (UP). UP is
containing all visited Websites' information and their relevant keywords. We mean by
"relevant keywords" the keywords the user entered when s/he searches and the Websites'
keywords gathered from their titles and summary. When the user enters new keywords to
search for, CAIA will refine the user's query then it will start the search process. After that, it
will display the search results and it will issue a process to monitor the user's behaviors on the
search results. CAIA has been tested and the testing results shows a big improvement in the
Internet Search using CAIA compared to famous search engines such as Google.
