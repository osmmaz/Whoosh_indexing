Recently, biometric systems have attracted the attention of both academic and industrial
communities. Advances in hardware and software technologies have paved the way to
such growing interest. Nowadays, efficient and cost effective biometric solutions are
continuously emerging. Fingerprint based biometric systems have pioneered the
commercial applications. Face and iris traits have been proven to be reliable candidates.
Until recently, face recognition research literally followed the research undertaken in the
field of fingerprint recognition which is inherently gray scale. In this research, efforts are
restricted to the investigation of subspace representations in the color domain. The
concept of principal component analysis (PCA) implemented via singular value
decomposition (SVD) is carried over into the hypercomplex (i.e., quaternionic) to define
quaternionic PCA (Q PCA) where color faces are compactly represented. Unlike the
existing approaches for handling the color information, the proposed research implicitly
accounts for the correlation that exists between the color components (i.e., red, green and
blue components).
