Biometric systems have gradually become an accepted mean for person identification and
verification. Recently, person identification using iris features has received a lot of
attention in both research and industry communities. This is mainly due to the unique
characteristics and texture found in iris images. Most proposed iris recognition techniques
are based on gray level representations. The aim of this research is to develop and
investigate novel methods for the automatic recognition and matching of color iris images
based on hypercomplex (Quaternion) representations. The performance of Quaternion
image representation is compared with that of other representations, and a study of the
results is conducted. The well known IrisCode algorithm, developed by John Daugman,
is extended to the color domain. Furthermore, in the present research, hypercomplex
processing and filtering of color iris images are defined.
