As organizations strive for means of providing more secure methods for user
access, biometrics is gaining increasing attention. However a biometric recognition
system good for one case study may not be accurate for the other one. One solution
to the problem is combining classifiers; so that the complementary information
departed by different classifiers could be combined, in an efficient way, to achieve a
much better recognition rate as compared to the participating experts. In this context
the Dempster Shafer theory of evidence (DST) has shown some promising results;
however the D ST has not yet been explored for the problem of biometric recognition
systems. In this thesis we have proposed three novel algorithms to combine different
biometric systems using the DST. NNEF (Nearest Neighbor Based Evidence Fusion)
algorithm uses the nearest neighbor distance of the participating experts as an
evidence estimation parameter; RR EF (Recognition Rate Based Evidence Fusion)
algorithm uses the performance parameters of the participating experts for evidence
estimation and VEF (Variance Based Evidence Fusion) algorithm uses the second
order statistics of decision parameters to estimate the belief in the combining experts.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on uni modal (speech only) and
multi modal (speech and face) biometric recognition systems; the simulation results
have shown that our proposed algorithms achieve much better recognition rate than
the individual classifiers.
