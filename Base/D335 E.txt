The concept of green environment, security of oil supply, and the increased use of
renewable energy resources (RES) in power grids are all factors that are increasing the
focus on Electric Vehicles (EVs). The charging of these EVs can be a relatively large
load in the distribution grid. If the charging is not managed properly the distribution grid
can be affected negatively. Therefore, charging EVs without any negative impacts on the
distribution grid is important for their successful integration in large numbers.
This work is intended to develop a communication free i.e. an autonomous voltage
feedback control structure, for EV charging. This control structure relies on the local
voltage measurement at the point where EV is plugged in. It compares the system
measured voltage at the point of charging with a predefined reference voltage. The EV
charging is reduced as the system voltage approaches this reference. The reduced
charging rate takes into account the EV battery state of charge (SOC) and the owner’s
end of charge time (ECT) preference. The proposed control structure has been simulated
on an eighteen bus distribution system. The performance of the control strategy has been
tested under the presence of voltage control devices. A contingency analysis was also
performed to ensure the system’s robustness. The simulation results show that this method can successfully reduce EV charging to eliminate system voltage violations that
would otherwise be caused from EV charging while ensuring fairness among the various
EVs. In addition, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
flattening the distribution feeder’s load profile during periods of intense charging and
robustness under certain contingencies. The proposed strategy is also tested on Real Time
Digital Simulator (RTDS). A basic incentive program is also proposed for those EV
owners who would participate in the proposed program.
