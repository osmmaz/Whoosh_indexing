Thinly laminated formations, composed of sand shale sequences, refer to beds of
thickness that are below the vertical resolution of standard formation evaluation log
measurements. These thinly bedded formations could be significant hydrocarbon
reservoirs particularly in turbidite or fluvial depositional environments, which are usually
showing mixture of fine and coarse grains.
Standard formation evaluation methods using conventional logs (Gamma ray formation
resistivity Neutron and Density) in the thinly bedded formations overestimate the volume
of clay (VCL) and underestimate porosity and hydrocarbon saturations.
Advanced analyses are required to fully characterize and evaluate the property of thin
beds and to obtain improved hydrocarbon estimations. Such analyses are provided by the
Laminated Sand Analysis (LSA) techniques that use data including Wireline Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Resistivity Borehole Images and Triaxial resistivity logs.
In the Thesis I worked out two case studies, in fluvial and turbidite environments, in
order to better evaluate thinly bedded intervals within clastic reservoirs. I applied LSA techniques in these two case studies in which the formation evaluation was computed and
compared with the standard formation evaluation using conventional logs.
