Differential Electrolytic Potentiometry has been applied successfully as
a detector for Sequential Injection Analysis combined with flow injection system, this
method was utilized in different types of ion combination and charge transfer
reactions. The developed methods was used for the determination of cyanide in real
water samples using two silver amalgam electrodes, with high selectivity and the
method was compared with the standard methods. Cyanide was also determined by
sequential injection analysis method using spectrophotometric detection.
The DEP detection system was applied for sequential injection determination of
Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Procainamide hydrochloride and ascorbic acid using
platinum working electrodes, the method was applied for real samples and it was
compared with the standard methods. For all the studied systems the variables that
affect the signals were investigated using the univariate method of optimization, those
variables include reagent solution concentration, flow rate, volumes, current density
and delay time.
The developed methods are rapid, simple, less costly and precise compared to other
methods. Cinoxacin antibiotic was determined using simple titrimetric method based
on DEP detection, using antimony electrodes. Lansoprazole and Pantoprazole were
also determined using kinetic spectrophotometric method based by their oxidation
reaction with Potassium permanganate. For the first time DEP was coupled with
HPLC as a potential detector and it was applied for the determination of Ascorbic
acid in real samples successfully.
