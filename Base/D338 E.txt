A decentralized model following approach to design a suboptimal
controller for large Interconnected dynamical systems Is considered. The
system is assumed to be subjected to an input disturbance. Interactions
betw een subsystems are represented by a reduced order model. Gain
param eters of the decentralized controller are independent of the initial
conditions.
A modified decentralized model following controller is also
developed and compared w ith the previous approach through an illustrative
example. The im plem entation of the developed controller is simpler than the
first approach. The resulting controller can be easily implemented using
microprocessors.
