Real time applications of neural networks demand high performance systems. Neural
networks may be naturally represented by macro dataflow graphs. Dataflow
machines therefore offer suitable platforms for simulation of these networks. In this
thesis, the hardware requirements for neural computing are first discussed. The
rationale of dataflow approach to neural computing is presented. A new neural
dataflow processor architecture based on argument fetching •principles is proposed.
The proposed architectural model is static and flexible to exploit different levels of
parallelism offered by neural networks through the use of software pipelining. The
architecture is studied by extensive simulations using some neural network examples
with various parameters. Back propagation and Hopfield networks are transformed
into dataflow graphs in order to execute on the machine. The simulation shows good
performance results.
