During my studying period at the program of Comparative Religion,
the College of Islamic Studies, I was struck by the term (Religious
Hierarchy), which has not been dealt with a lot in sources and
references of the displine of Comparative Religion, at least not in
the studies that I have come across in the Arab World, on the hand
of the structure and authority.
Most studies alluded to it under other titles, like discussions of
questions relating to Priesthood, and the powers vested in
clergymen or religious seminaries where Shiite clerics are trained
in the framework of researching into the role played by priests in
religions or the status and ranking of jurisprudents.
In addition, the Arabic library is lacking when it comes to studies
on the roots of framing the classes of Priesthood and their
formulation within the settings of different religions, their
development with the passage of time, to be established and
continuously refined by events and needs and subsequently
shaped into both overt and covert structures in line with conditions
in which they had been established and in accordance to their
relations with the ruling regimes they were contemporary to.
Since the Department of Comparative Religion makes it a
condition that a research should involve two religions or sects, it
seemed to me after the literature review to confine my work into
two religions, Islam and Christianity and comparing them, and
choosing two sects, which are Catholicism and the Imami
Twelvers.
As is required in the methodology, the thesis has a preface, an
introduction and three chapters followed by a conclusion. In the
preface, I dealt with the meaning of religious hierarchy literary and
as a terminology sighting different examples of religiosity in
different religions.
Chapter One is devoted to elaborating the concept of hierarchy
within the church and its stages of formation and development, theimpact of schisms and divisions within the church, in addition to
the law governing the hierarchical order in the Catholic church.
Chapter Two deals entirely with the establishment of religious
hierarchy within the Shi'i tradition and its development, the
establishment of religious Hawzas (seminaries) where Shi'i clerics
are trained  and the role of Jurists in what is known as (The
Absence of the 12th Imam), then the establishment of the Wilayat
Al Faqeeh (Guardianship of the Jurist) and its historical
development.
As for chapter three, it comprises a comparison between the
function of Religious Hierarchy within Papal Catholicism and the
Shiite Marjiyyah (religious reference) and what it has become into
in this day and age.
