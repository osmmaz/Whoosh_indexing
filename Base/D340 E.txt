The objectives of this thesis are to identify and assess the factors influencing the decision
to outsource and also to develop a decision making framework for outsourcing of the
maintenance services in Saudi universities. The methodology adopted in this research
consists of two phases. First, the research focused on acquiring the knowledge through an
extensive literature review about the outsourcing decision factors from the viewpoint of
researchers. Then, interviews were conducted with two maintenance department
managers in KFUPM & KFU for a pilot study, and surveys were carried out at eleven
Saudi universities. This resulted in identifying thirty eight factors classified under six
categories namely: Strategic, Management, Technological, Quality, Economic, and
Function Characteristics. In the second phase, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was
used to establish weights and priorities of the factors. Participants agreed on Quality and
then Cost as the most important categories, and outsource the maintenance services with
priority of 77 . Participants ranked "Improve quality requirements" and "Achieve
quality for competitive advantage" as the most important factors for the outsourcing
decision. Then the AHP method was used to construct the framework for decisionmaking
the outsourcing of the maintenance services of Saudi universities. Finally, some
recommendations are given. The findings may provide value for the universities in Saudi
Arabia confronted with the decision of whether or not to outsource.
