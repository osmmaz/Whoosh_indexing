The non linear structure o f neural networks makes it very suitable fo r channel
equalization, especially when the channel is heavily distorted. In this thesis we
investigate the performance o f three different Neural Network based Decision Feedback
Equalization schemes with and without Lattice filler. The lattice structures arc well
known fo r their fa st convergence and insensitivity to the eigen value spread o f the
channel autocorrelation matrix. First, the performance o f Radial Basis Function network
trained through simple Least Mean Square algorithm is investigated fo r Decision
Feedback Equalization. Second, the Multi Layer Perceptron trained through Recursive
Least Squares algorithm is used fo r DFE and its performance is investigated. Finally, the
hybrid neural network based structure is proposed fo r on line training o f DFE.
These proposed schemes are investigated by means o f computer simulations and results
are presented fo r static and time varying channels in the form o f Learning Curves and Bit
Error Rate fo r different equalizer configurations.
