The quality of water resources in a water scarce country like the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia is an issue requiring a great deal of attention. Pollution from the production and
use of chemicals poses a threat to the Kingdom’s water resources. Methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) is one such compound encountered in groundwater. MTBE is a fuel
additive that replaced tetraethyl lead as the main anti knocking agent and is used to
enhance octane rating in refined fuels. Treatment of MTBE contaminated water by
conventional methods (air stripping, adsorption onto activated carbon and
biodegradation) is challenging due to its unique properties of high water solubility, low
adsorption onto solids and resistance to biodegradation. Advanced oxidation processes
(AOPs), however, seem to be a promising treatment option for water contaminated by
MTBE and other organics. Photocatalysis is one form of AOPs that utilizes ultraviolet
(UV) or visible light radiation in combination with a semiconductor photocatalyst. In this
study, titanium dioxide (TiO2), multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and TiO2
supported on MWCNT (TiO2 MWCNT) composites were used in combination with
ultraviolet (UV) light radiation to photocatalytically degrade MTBE in spiked water
samples. The removal of MTBE as well as its expected degradation by products: acetone,
tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and tertiary butyl formate (TBF) were studied under
different experimental conditions; TiO2, MWCNT and TiO2 MWCNT dosage (1 mg, 10
mg and 20 mg) and UV light intensity (0.98 mW/cm2, 1.12 mW/cm2 and 2.17 mW/cm2)
were examined. MTBE removal was found to be mainly due to the photocatalytic effect
of TiO2 (with removal rates reaching up about 95  after treatment). MWCNTs with UV
light also demonstrated limited removal capabilities (with removal rates up to 68.21 );
though the mechanism by which this happens is not fully understood. The prepared TiO2 
MWCNT composites however showed the lowest removal rates.
