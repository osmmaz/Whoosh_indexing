This research discusses the delay in public water and sewage construction
projects in Saudi Arabia. It studies frequency, extent, and importance of causes
of delay in such projects. Sixty causes were identified and classified by source
into 6 groups.
A field survey was conducted through a structured questionnaire including
23 contractors, 12 consultant engineers, and 10 water & sewage authorities in
the Eastern Province and Riyadh Province. Frequency and extent of delay were
determined. SAS was used to analyze the data to present statistical measures and
to calculate the importance index and ranking of the causes for each individual
party and as an aggregate (standard) importance.
A hypothesis that the parties generally agree on the importance ranking of
the causes of delay was tested. It was concluded that the contractor disagrees
with the consultant and the owner in the importance ranking of the causes.
The research concluded that the delay occurred frequently in such projects,
specially in medium and large size projects, and that the extent of delay is
severe, specially in small projects. The study concluded that there are many
important causes of delay related mainly to owner involvement, contractor
performance, and the early planning and design of the project. Among these
important causes are financial problems, changes in the design and scope of the
projects, delay in making decisions and gaining approvals by the owner,
difficulties in obtaining work permits, and coordination and communication
problems.
