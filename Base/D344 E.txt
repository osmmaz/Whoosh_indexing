Densities o f the pure compounds o f Benzene, Cyclohexane and n Hexane as well as the
densities of their binary and ternary mixtures have been measured using an experimental
system whose accuracy and reliability have been previously established. The density
measurements were carried out over a wide range o f temperatures (am bient to 20(fC) and
concentrations. The experimental data were compared with predictions b y two renowned
correlations; the Hankinson Brobst Thompson correlation (H B T ) and the Spencer Danner
modified Rackett ( S D R ) equation. The two correlations appear to be quite satisfactory in
predicting the satu rated liquid density o f the pure and liquid mixtures considered. The
S D R predicts the experimental results with an overall average absolute deviation
(A A D   ) o f 0.29  , while the H B T has an AAD  o f 0.61  .
The excess molar volumes, Vf'* fo r the bi,nary liquid mixtures o f benzene and
cyclohexane, benzene and n hexane, and cyclohexane and n hexane from ambient to 20(fC,
were calculated fro m the density data. Values of the VE, fo r the three system s have been
correlated, first as function o f concentration using a 3 constant Redlich Kister expansion;
Vs = X ( 1   X ) \ A + B{ 1  2X ) + C ( /  2X )2 J
A n d secondly, as a function o f temperature by expressing the coefficients in the Redlich 
K ister expansion in term s o f temperature. Values o f VE have been found to be positive fo r
benzene and cyclohexane and benzene and n hexane mixtures. For cyclohexane and nhexane,
the values o f VE have been found to change from positive to negative with
increasing temperature.
The use o f the Lennard Jones poten tial to predict the density o f benzene, cyclohexane
and n hexane through the use o f molecular simulation was also investigated. The densities
o f benzene and n hexane were predicted with a reasonable degree o f accuracy, while the
predictions made f o r cyclohexane involved considerable errors.
