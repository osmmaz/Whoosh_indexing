Deployment of Triple Play services over IP networks has been on the increase across the
world particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Triple play services
provide voice, data, and multimedia services as those of streamed audio, video, and
IPTV. Network engineers and designers of these existing IP networks are faced with
numerous challenges with regards to assessing the readiness by gauging the capacity of
existing IP networks to support triple play services. In this research work, we present an
analytical and simulation approach to deploy triple play services. The capacity of a
network is gauged in terms of determining the maximum number of voice calls and
audio/video streaming sessions that can be sustained while satisfying QoS requirements
of all Triple Play services, and at the same time leaving adequate capacity for future
growth of the data network. We apply our approach with numerous scenarios on a
typical modern medium scale hospitality network. In particular, we consider the
deployment of SIP based VoIP, IP Unicast of audio/video streaming VoD, and IPMulticast
AV IPTV. Our analysis is based on the principles of queuing theory, and our
simulation is based on using OPNET
