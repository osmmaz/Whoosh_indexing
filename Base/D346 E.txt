Many interconnection networks have been proposed in the literature, but none has
wide ranging applicability. Hypercube networks are among the most commonly used
interconnection network topologies. However, they have the disadvantages that link
cost is exponential in network dimension and non constant node degree. Torus net 
works have a fixed degree and low link cost, but a diameter which is linear in net 
work size. Hierarchical interconnection networks provide a means to design networks
which have low link cost, and which take advantage of the locality of communication
existing in parallel applications. As network size increases, so does the probability
of network failure. To safeguard against failure, spare nodes and/or links are in 
corporated into the network. In this work. we design a hierarchical interconnection
network which has the desirable properties of the hypercube and the torus networks.
The performance of this network is evaluated, and a routing algorithm is proposed.
Fault tolerance is incorporated into this network, and it 's performance is compared
to that of some other networks. A reconfiguration strategy is proposed. and reliabil 
ity evaluation is undertaken. A Fault. Tolerant routing algorithm is proposed for this
architecture.
