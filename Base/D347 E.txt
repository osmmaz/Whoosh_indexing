Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems have attracted many researchers and have been included
in many standards such as IEEE, ANSI, NIST, SEC and WTLS. The ability
to use smaller keys and computationally more efficient algorithms compared with
earlier public key cryptosystems such as RSA and ElGamal are two main reasons
why elliptic curve cryptosystems are becoming more popular. They are considered to
be particularly suitable for implementation on sm art cards or mobile devices. Power
Analysis Attacks on such devices are considered serious threat due to the physical
characteristics of these devices and their use in potentially hostile environments.
This dissertation investigates elliptic curve cryptoprocessor architectures for curves
defined over GF(2m) fields. In this dissertation, new architectures th a t are suitable
for efficient com putation of scalar multiplications with resistance against power
analysis attacks are proposed and their performance evaluated. This is achieved
by exploiting parallelism and randomized processing techniques. Parallelism and
randomization are controlled at different levels to provide more efficiency and security.
Furthermore, the proposed architectures are flexible enough to allow designers
tailor performance and hardware requirements according to their performance and
cost objectives. The proposed architectures have been modeled using VHDL and
implemented on FPGA platform.
