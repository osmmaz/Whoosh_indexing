The title of this thesis is" Design &Fabrication of two Seated Aircraft with an
Advanced Rotating Leading Edge Wing", this gives almost a good description of the
work has been done. In this research, the moving surface boundary layer control
(MSBC) concept was investigated and implemented. An experimental model was
constructed and tested in wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics
using the leading edge moving surface of modified semi symmetric airfoil
NACA1214. The moving surface is provided by a high speed rotating cylinder, which
replaces the leading edge of the airfoil. The angle of attack, the cylinder surfaces
velocity ratio Uc/U, and the flap deflection angle effects on the lift and drag
coefficients and the stall angle of attack were investigated. This new technology was
applied to a 2 seat light sport aircraft that is designed and built in the Aerospace
Engineering Department at KFUPM. The project team is led by the aerospace
department chairman Dr. Ahmed Z. AL Garni and Dr. Wael G. Abdelrahman and
includes graduate and under graduate student. The wing was modified to include a
rotating cylinder along the leading edge of the flap portion.
This produced very promising results such as the increase of the maximum lift
coefficient at Uc/U=3 by 82  when flaps up and 111  when flaps down at 40° and
stall was delayed by 8degrees in both cases. The laboratory results also showed that
the effective range of the leading edge rotating cylinder is at low angles of attack
which reduce the need for higher angles of attack for STOL aircraft
