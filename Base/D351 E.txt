In this thesis, we present a high performance fault tolerant switch for B ISDN, called
the Reliable and Zealous Network (RAZAN). It consists of NLog2 N switching elements
of size n + 1 x n + 1, where N is the number o f inputs and n = Log^N is the
number of stages. The performance of the network is evaluated analytically as well
as through simulation under uniform traffic load. R AZAN shows a high throughput
in the presence or absence of faults compared to a number of recently introduced
networks. Moreover, R A Z A N has a high terminal reliability even for large network
sizes. The architecture o f R AZAN also offers high fault tolerance, in sequence delivery
of cells, simple routing, and regularity.
