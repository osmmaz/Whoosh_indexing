A small scale hazardous chemical liquid waste incinerator is designed, constructed and
operated. The design was based on the thermodynamics parameters e.g. temperature and
volume. The chamber, the insulation, the feed system and the cooling system were
designed and constructed at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. Making use
of the heat generated by the incinerator, the liquid waste is converted to vapor before
entering the burner. An on line monitoring system was assembled and operated.
Automation was implemented using the microprocessor of the gas chromatograph (GC)
used in the monitoring system.
Simulated waste consisting of a mixture o f benzene and heptane has been studied. A better
than 99.99  destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) has been achieved. A unique method is proposed for the control of the incinerator. Previous methods depend
on the analysis of the exhaust gas. The new technique is based on the correlation of the
voltage developed in the flame with the DRE. Under steady state conditions, a correlation
between the measured voltage and the concentrations of some species in the exhaust gas
has been observed. The voltage probe acts as an active sensor that gives very fast
information about the incineration process. This information allows for fast corrective
actions without waiting for the analysis of the exhaust gas.
