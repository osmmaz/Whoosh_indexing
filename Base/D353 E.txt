The IEEE 802.11 based wireless local area networks (WLANs) have enjoyed popularity in many segments. In highly dynamic environments like Rescue missions or RoboCup, the communications among multiple robots are performed by broadcasting the data to their teammates called an Auction. Reliable, fast, and power aware communication is needed for these types of Ad Hoc wireless networks. Broadcasting in IEEE 802.11 does not support any MAC layer recovery as a result due to interference and collisions in the wireless networks, this mechanism leaves broadcasting unreliable. Currently available techniques are based on Client Server and Publish/Subscribe communication models, and are not suitable for multi robot systems in which each robot acts like a peer. For this, we proposed reliable peer to peer communication protocols such as UDP P2P Reliable Broadcast with Token Passing and UDP P2P Reliable Distributed Broadcast. The protocols are implemented on a WLAN using the Stargate embedded system. The protocols are implemented using (1) a communication thread (TC) and (2) a processing thread (TP). A testbed system, which allows modules to run TC and TP, in addition to the generation of broadcast request, is presented in this thesis. Symmetric code is run in all the nodes (peer to peer communication). The evaluation of the protocols revealed : Response times are comparable to the UBTP auction scheme operated at head node, improved degree of reliability; at most 3 steps for seven nodes for UDP P2P Reliable Broadcast with Token Passing scheme, and at most 4 steps for seven nodes for UDP P2P Reliable Distributed Broadcast scheme. Comparable power consumption to simple UBTP auction scheme, slight variations in the average auction times when devices are mobile, symmetric performance pattern of all the nodes in both the proposed protocols.
