Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) code tracking performance has been shown to
depend on both the correlation properties o f the spreading codes and the actual pulse
shape utilized. This work quantifies the impact o f pulse shaping on the performance o f
the noncoherent delay lock loop used in code tracking in direct sequence spread
spectrum systems. Several families o f pulses are considered. The effect o f pulse shaping
is demonstrated in the presence o f multiple access interference. Optimization based on
the use o f Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions is carried out to determine optimal pulse
shapes in terms o f minimum tracking jitter. The optimized pulse shapes are obtained and
their performance compared to conventional pulse shapes. Finally, the implementation o f
the digital tracking loop is carried out using a Digital Signal Processor (DSP).
