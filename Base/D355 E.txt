A high performance fault tolerant Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switching
fabric architecture called Binary Tree Banyan Network (BTBN) is proposed. It is
based on two interconnected parallel banyan networks in a binary tree form. Many
ATM switching fabric architectures are proposed in the literature; however, few of
them consider both the throughput performance measure and fault tolerance feature in
the design. Compared to known and recent switching fabric architectures, BTBN has
demonstrated very low cell loss probability and high throughput under normal
operation and in the presence o f faulty switching element conditions. In addition, any
multistage interconnection networks (MIN) such as OMEGA, Delta, Baseline, and any
topologically equivalent networks can be used in the BTBN switching fabric. BTBN
requires less transmission latency than the simple baseline network, delivers all input
cells in the right sequence using simple and distributed self routing algorithm, and
does not have jitter or Head Of Line (HOL) problems. In addition, BTBN is modular,
scalable, and can be recursively expanded easily.
