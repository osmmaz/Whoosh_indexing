Advances in networking and data processing speeds have led to the need for high speed
cryptosystems. The speed o f a cryptosystem is function o f its complexity and the
technology used to implement it. This work investigates the techniques o f designing fa st
modulo multipliers since modulo multiplication is a basic essential operation in public key
cryptography. Two types o f modulo multipliers have been designed and modeled using
VHDL and MatLab. While the first multiplier is based on asynchronous adder design, the
other multiplier is based on four to two compressor design. In addition, a Built In Self
Test (BIST) methodology has been developed for the Compressor based multiplier
design. The two multiplier designs have been evaluated and compared based on their
area delay cost.
