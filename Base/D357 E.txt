Power divider circuits are used in radio/microwave frequency applications to split an
input signal over two or more output signals with equal or unequal amplitude or phase.
Effective design of power dividers is crucial to minimize the dimensions and losses of
microwave systems, such as antenna feeders, especially for large phased array antennas.
Wilkinson and Gysel are among the popular power dividers and are often implemented
using microstrip circuits to achieve minimal insertion loss, high isolation between output
ports and exceptional phase and amplitude balance. But to use them in recent multilayer
devices such as laminated multi chip modules, vertical transitions are needed to
distribute the input and output ports in different layers. However, the use of these
transitions increases the insertion loss of the power divider and limits the operational
bandwidth.
