Graphics modeling is an essential part of computer graphics that plays a vital
role in many applications. Existing graphics modeling systems don’t offer sufficient
flexibility to the end user (the designer) at different levels of abstraction. Our
goal is to design a graphics modeling system that raises the level of interaction to
the application level. To achieve this goal, we developed various techniques that
enhance the modeling process. The object orientation methodology was adopted
and incorporated with a hierarchical modeling scheme that supports bottom up
construction and top down decomposition. The modeling process was enhanced
further by supporting the manipulation of constraints on object attributes which
automates satisfying system requirements. Based on these techniques, a 3D graphics
modeling system was designed. A subset of the design was implemented on the
NeXTStep platform to help in testing and developing the introduced techniques.
