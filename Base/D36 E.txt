This study aimed to identify the role of awareness campaigns in forming the Qatari
audience knowledge and awareness in adopting positive behaviors. It also targets
measuring the level of Qatari audience exposure to these awareness campaigns, and
the level of their knowledge in relation to its contents and topics. Furthermore, aimed
to monitoring the positive and negative aspects of the campaigns organized in order to
maximize the benefits of them in other fields. To achieve the goals of this study, the
researcher adopted descriptive approach, using the questionnaire as a main tool for
data collection when gathering information from 480 sample of Qatari audience.
One of the main findings of this study is the high proportion of medium sized viewing
to the following campaigns: “Our Future Lies in Our Health”, “Take Care”, “We All
See You”, and “Tarsheed” program, as the number of viewings for each of the study
sample from (3 to 5) times. The findings also pointed out that the majority of the
sample study is interested to a certain extent in watching these campaigns. One of the
most important results is finding out that negative trend towards elements of the
campaign outnumbered positive and neutral trends. Results also pointed out that 41.3 
of the sample did not believe that such campaigns are able to change audience
behavior, or that they can encourage them to adopt positive behaviors set by the
campaign mainly because of the mystery and lack of clarity for goals of such
campaigns. On the other hand, 27.7  of the study sample believed that these
campaigns are able to change audience behavior, and clarity of goals is the main
reason.
