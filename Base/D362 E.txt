Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
Access (OFDMA) systems have great potential for providing enormous capacity due to its
integrated space frequency and multi user diversity. It is generally hard to find an optimal
solution for sub channel and power allocation in a multiuser MIMO OFDMA system that
maximizes the overall systems capacity, given proportional rate constraints. In this thesis,
an adaptive subcarrier and power allocation scheme is proposed for a MIMO OFDMA
system. This algorithm optimizes power distribution, guarantees quality of service
requirements, and ensures fairness to all active users. In addition, the performance of the
designed algorithm is also investigated by applying it to practical MIMO schemes, taking
into account adaptive modulation and bit loading techniques. Simulation results show that
the proposed scheme satisfies the proportional rate constraints in strict sense and
therefore can provide absolute rate guarantees in contrast to other schemes found in
literature.
