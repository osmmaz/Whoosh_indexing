This thesis studies three major issues that affect deployment of wireless network in
Industrial Plants for monitoring and control. Many benefits are acquired by using
wireless communication systems in industries such as financial saving, safer for
maintenance, and easier diagnosing. The First issue is to assess suitability of wireless
technologies for industrial networks. This thesis evaluates WPAN (IEEE802.15) and
WLAN (IEEE802.11) as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi Fi and SP100 are candidate
networks. The Second hurdle is to characterize the industrial environment from
radio wave propagation aspects. Extensive measurements are done in Hot Strip Mill
and resulting Impulse responses are analyzed. The Third issue is of performance of
candidate data transmission formats to determine data rates and ensuring bit error
rates.
