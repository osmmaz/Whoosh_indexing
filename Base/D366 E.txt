The use of microwave energy to heat ceramics at high temperatures has gained
increasing interest because of its industrial applications. The technique saves both energy
and time, and it improves the materials' properties. In this thesis, we have designed and
tested more than 20 heaters which were made of SiC based composite materials that show
a strong and fast microwave absorption in a kitchen microwave oven (2.45GHz, 1.5 KW).
The tests were very promising as some heaters could be heated up to temperatures close to
T= 1750°C in four minutes. The highest temperatures (1650°C and 1750°C) were obtained
in the case of (90  SiC + 10  A1203) heater and (90  SiC + 10  V203) heater
respectively. Different compositions were investigated and structural analyses of the
samples before and after treatment were carried out by X ray Diffraction (XRD) and
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM/EDS). The results showed that many oxide
nanostructures were formed after microwave exposure along with new phases. Successful
tests have been reported in this thesis about sintering alumina titania (70  AI2O3 +
30 TiO2> at 1350°C for 5 minutes in a microwave oven and a conventional furnace. Many nanostructures of zinc oxide powder have been synthesized by evaporationoxidation
of metallic zinc using microwave heaters within 1.5 minutes
