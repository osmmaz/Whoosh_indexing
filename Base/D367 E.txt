Telerobotics is a multidisciplinary area that aims at extending eye hand motion
co ordination through a distance using real time wired or wireless computer networks.
It uses a master arm to describe hand motion, slave arm to reproduce hand motion,
and stereo vision, haptic and force feedback to extend human depth perception and
senses. Some of the telerobotic applications are operating in deep space, underwater,
nano and micro scales, carrying out surgery inside the patient body, etc. One of the
most critical problems of such system is the communication delay that often causes
teleoperation instability. In this work, an Augmented Reality (AR) based telerobotic
system is proposed that allows developing and validating a teleoperation plan by
superimposing some virtual objects onto the real video image of the workspace. The
plan substitutes frequent low level interactions between the user and the remote site
by sending only the finalized data and thus, reduces real time network interactions. It
also increases the task safety. To develop the system, a serial six DOF 3D graphical
arm is designed based on its geometric model. Then, accurate camera calibration and
registration methods are used to superimpose the graphical arm onto the video image.
Motion activation algorithms are developed and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is
designed to facilitate the task simulation. DirectZD of Microsoft D irectX 9 is used
as graphics A P I that exploits hardware acceleration for graphics rendition through
Hardware Abstraction layer (HAL). The overall system is designed using Microsoft
.N E T framework with Visual C # .N E T programming and tested on a stereovision
system operating over a L A N with a PUMA 560 robot. The system performed well with improved accuracy and refresh rate of graphics on the output screen.
