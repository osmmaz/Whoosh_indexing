Over 50  of the original oil in place is left behind after prim ary and
secondary recovery. Alkali surfaclant polymcr (ASP) flooding process has been
found to be capable of recovering some of the oil left behind after prim ary and
secondary recovery. The polymer increases the macroscopic displacement
efficiency. The alkali and surfactant lower the inlcrfacial tension (IFT) which
results in higher microscopic displacement efficiency.
An alkalinc surfactant polymer enhanced oil recovery (F.OR) scheme was
proposed for Saudi Arabian limestone reservoirs
The intcrrraction between the reservoir brine, alkali, surfactant and
polymer was investigated. The slug was formulated with a mixture of sodijjm
bicarbonate and sodium carbonate. B1083 anionic surfactant was chosen for the
slug because it was thermally stable at the studied reservoir tem perature of
90 °C. A watcr in oil emulsion was formed in the B1083 surfactant/crude oil
system. The presence of alkali and surfactant led to a decrease in the viscosity
of the polymer (Flocon 4800C) solution. The addition of alkali to the surfactant
solution did not result in any further dccracsc in the IFT of the surfactant/crude
oil system. The adsopiion of surfactant in the presence of alkali was lower than
that without alkali. However, the percent reduction in adsorption decreases with
increasing surfactant concentration. A new relationship for calculating the shear
rate in porous media was developed.
