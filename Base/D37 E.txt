This study aims to propose a frame for how Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) should
be, as well as demonstrates their capability of channeling financial resources towards
economic development. In light of the surge in unemployment rates, particularly
among large spectrums of youth, the study proposes financial vehicles and
mechanisms for directing funding towards constructive investment activities in an
endeavor to catch up with our time’s advancement. Among its key outcomes, this
research proves that Islamic finance works on optimum allocation of financial
resources, as well as channeling such resources to high productivity projects. It shows
that equal economic opportunities are available to all individual within the society
under the Islamic finance transactions as well as states that individual stockholders
under Profit/Loss Sharing are income distribution favored benefiters on the long term.
The research also demonstrate that income distribution does not favor interest
transaction dealers  who are more likely vulnerable to capital losses in case of
enormous rates of inflation where net profits comes in negative figures. Through
analysis of the sources and uses of a sample of IFIs, the outcomes also demonstrate
that around 80  to 60  of funds are sourced from customers’ deposits, whereas
about 62  to 75  of the uses are directed to finance activities and around 50  to
90  of finance activities through Murabaha contracts that mostly entail consumable
goods. Furthermore, the study outcomes reveals how IFIs are vulnerable to higher
risks in comparison with traditional banks due to the applicable laws, legislations, and
positive courts systems that are different from their counterparts in Islamic Sharia
within the Arab countries.
