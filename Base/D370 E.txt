A major problem in many public address systems of large halls is the poor perception
of message due to multiple reflections   echoes   in the hall. The general
approach to this problem is to identify the characteristics of the echo path and
then generate an echo replica which cancels out the real echo signed.
In this thesis, a novel structured FIR equalizer is proposed for the cancellation
process. It requires less taps than the existing equalizers and operates directly on
the dominant echoes to generate an efficient echo replica. Extensive simulation
studies are carried out for evaluating the performance of the proposed acoustic echo
canceller. The new approach considerably improves the computational complexity
and enables possible implementations on commercial DSP boards.
