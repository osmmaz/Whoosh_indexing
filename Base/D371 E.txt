This thesis proposes an approach for computing coupling metrics from object
oriented UML models stored in XMI format. The coupling metrics are
computed from the package, class and sequence diagrams in the UML
model. A metric tool is developed for extracting the design level information
and computing the metrics. Our experimental results are discussed and
compared with results from source level metrics. Results show that design
level coupling metrics are consistent with those computed from the source
code.
