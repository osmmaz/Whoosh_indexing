Finite time thermodynamic models which simulate the working o f actual vapor com pression
refrigeration systems are developed. The characteristic performance curves
o f the refrigeration systems that include simple vapor compression system , m echanical
subcooling and two stage system s are presented in terms o f the coefficient of
performance (C O P ) and cooling capacity o f the system ( Q eVap)  Using the data obtained
from the thermodynamic models, performance curves of the system s are obtained.
The resulting relationship between the C O P and Qcvap is explained in light
o f various irreversible losses o f the system. These losses are due to fin ite rate o f
heat transfer in the heat exchangers and the non isentropic compression and expansion
in the compressor(s) and expansion valve(s) o f the systems, respectively. The
thermodynaic models are also used fo r predicting an optim um distribution o f the total
heat exchanger area between the individual heat exchangers o f the system s. The
results obtained from the thermodynamic models are also compared with an actual
performance o f a simple vapor compression system. I t is found that the perform ance
characteristics predicted by the thermodynamic model is very close (w ithin f_2 )
than that shown by actual experimental results.
