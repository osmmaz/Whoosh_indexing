Replaceablilty of systems within buildings is essential if the building
investment is to be sustained. The objective of the thesis was to develop guidelines
for use by designers of new high rise office buildings to facilitate systems
replacement in the future. Data upon which guidelines could be formulated were
obtained from the literature and from experts. Experts were issued with a
preliminary questionnaire as a basis for their contribution. Some experts filled the
questionnaire; others wrote letters of their experience and made suggestions.
Guidelines were then formulated.
Embodiments of the guidelines were developed to check that the guidelines
were applicable and to discover the need for guidelines out of the design process.
The embodiments, where appropriate, were developed into additional guidelines.
The final form of guidelines was pre tested by four architects and an engineer.
Guidelines were then distributed to design professionals throughout the World.
Responses were received from some of the best known and most highly respected
architects and engineers in the USA and Australia, and others from Singapore,
Canada, the U.K., Spain, Japan, Kuwait in addition to Saudi Arabia.
A total of eighty five design professionals completed the assessment of the
guidelines which were in the form of a questionnaire with 273 guidelines and
explanations. 100  of the guidelines were judged as "Useful", "Very Useful" or
"Essential". The statistical analysis of judgments of the total of the experts rated 13
of the guidelines as "Essential", 166 as "Very Useful" and 94 as "Useful". Top
architects in the USA and Australia with an average of 30 years experience, rated
most of the guidelines as "Essential".
The research achieved its objective : to develop guidelines for design for
systems replacement in high rise office buildings
