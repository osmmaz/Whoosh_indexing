The design and fabrication of a wide band programmable microwave feed network
is proposed. The design architecture is composed of four main stages, switching,
phase shifting, ampli cation/attenuation and control. The proposed feed network
is designed to cover a wide band from 2.5 to 6 GHz over two separate branches, one
covers from 2.5 to 3 GHz and the other covers from 3 to 6 GHz. Digitally controlled
phase shifters are used to control the phase. A digital control unit is used to provide
the required control signals for all the feed network stages. Digitally controlled
wide band variable gain ampli ers are used to set the appropriate amplitude to the
signal in both paths.
The feed network is simulated and fabricated on an FR 4 substrate with thick 
ness of 0:8mm. Good matching between simulation and measurement results is  achieved.The measured amplitude resolution was 0.5 dB with an error of less than
+0.22/ 0.12 dB. The measured phase resolution was approximately 5.625  with
an error of less than  1 . This value of phase resolution can achieve a scanning
beam resolution of 1:8  for a linear antenna array. Also, the sidelobe levels can
be controlled by amplitude tapering functionality of the proposed network. The
proposed network is a generic two path design that can be used as a standalone
network to feed any kind of array system. The size of the two path feed network
was 110   63   0:8mm3.
Since the feed network needs a kind of combiner circuit to combine all the outputs
from the network to the input of a transceiver, a compact size 12 port microwave
combiner with phase compensation is designed and fabricated. The combiner cov 
ers the band from 2.3 to 3 GHz. Its size was 78:5   61   0:8mm3.
