A solution to the problem of designing a linear phase, Nyquist d ata transmission
filter with rapidly decaying impulse response beyond the main lobe is attempted.
Based on a recent contribution [l], the proposed technique utilizes its filter model
to maximize the ratio of the energy within a specific time duration to the total
energy under the full bandwidth. The denominator of the transfer functions is the
linear phase polynomial and the design involves the determination of the numerator
coefficients to meet the required specifications. The signal shapes thus obtained are
useful in combating intersymbol interference and are almost immune to jitte r effects
at the receiver
