In the present work a design methodology is developed to protect brittle ceramic materials
from failure during drawing operations. Analytical and Finite Element techniques
are employed to study straight taper and contoured dies respectively. Variation
of shrink fit pressure is studied by systematically varying some important process parameters.
It is found that area reduction and exit wire velocity significantly affect
shrink fit pressure. Effect of radial thickness is significant only fo r small thicknesses.
Semi die angle and die length have almost no effect on shrink fit pressure. A comparison
between the analytical and Finite Element approach shows that the analytical
approach produces good results for small reductions and die angles
