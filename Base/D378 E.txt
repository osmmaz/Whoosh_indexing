In this research, the problem of complex valued  nite impulse response FIR wave 
 eld extrapolation  lter design is considered as a linear complimentarity problem
(LCP). LCP is not an optimization technique as there is no objective function to
optimize, however, quadratic programming, one of the applications of LCP, can
be used to  nd an optimal solution for the 1 D FIR wave eld extrapolation  lter.
Quadratic programs are an extremely important source of applications of LCP,
in fact, several algorithms for quadratic programs are based on LCP. This work
shows the e orts that are being made to convert the FIR wave eld extrapolation
 lter design problem into a quadratic program and then  nally, to an equivalent
linear complimenatarity problem. There are two families of algorithms available
to solve for the LCP: a direct (pivoting based) algorithms, and b indirect (iterative) algorithms . In this study, the LCP has been solved by a direct, Lemke0s
algorithm, and indirect, Fisher Newton algorithm. In the explicit depth extrap 
olation process, FIR wave eld extrapolation  lters are used recursively. Hence,
the challenge is to design these  lters with smallest possible length while keeping
passband error as small as possible. To achieve the above design constraints, the
problem of designing a 1 D FIR wave eld extrapolation  lter has also been studied
via L1 error approximation approach.
Performance of 1 D FIR extrapolation  lters designed by the proposed methods has
been tested by extrapolating the challenging 2 D SEG/EAGE salt velocity model.
