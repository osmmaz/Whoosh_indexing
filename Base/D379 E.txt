The main idea of equalization is simply to compensate for nonidcal
characteristics by additional filtering. An equalizer is, then, an adaptive filter
that is capable of high speed digital signaling over slowly varying, band limited
channels whose impulse responses are unknown at the receiver.
Among the most widely used equalizers are the synchronous equalizer and
the fractionally spaced equalizer. In the synchronous equalizer the tap
coefficients are spaced at the reciprocal of the symbol rate. While in a
fractionally spaced equalizer, on the other hand, the tap coefficients are spaced
closer than the reciprocal of the symbol rate.
The fractionally spaced equalizer is superior to the synchronous equalizer,
and this is in its ability to be not affected by aliasing problems and independent
of the sampler phase. However, for a given time span NT, a synchronous
equalizer will need N tap coefficients, while (2N) tap coefficients are needed for
a fractionally spaced equalizer with tap spacing T/2. This will result in a great
amount of computations needed to update the tap coefficients every symbol
period, an important drawback of the fractionally spaced equalizer.
In this thesis, we introduce an idea where a compromise between
performance and complexity, for both equalizers, is presented. The idea consists
of setting some of the tap coefficients of a fractionally spaced equalizer, with tap
spacing T/2, to zero. The zero tap coefficients are neither updated nor entered in
the computational process, thus leading to simplified algorithms.
The study was carried out through simulation for PAM and QAM systems.
Simulation results show the validity of the proposed equalizer
