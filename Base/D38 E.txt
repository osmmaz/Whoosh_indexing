Software measurement methods play an important role in determining the quality and methods of maintaining software programs.
Link measurement methods are one of the types of program metrics methods that measure components
Interconnecting interfaces of software components. There is an urgent need for a system that represents a fixed base for all
Methods of correlation metrics This system must be able to collect, store and analyze measurements
Automatic linkage systems.
In this thesis, a new method based on conversion of the programming language blocks was presented
High synthetic to a higher abstract level. This abstract level is not related to any language
Or any operating system and contains the basic components required to do calculations
Interconnection and conceals the unnecessary components in the correlation calculations. The level has been converted
Abstract to a relative model to be then saved and stored in a relative database.
