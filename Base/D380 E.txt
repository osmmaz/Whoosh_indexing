radiating patches are universally accepted as popular antenna structures due to
their versatile feeding techniques, light weight and conformable nature. However,
this class of single element antennas are inherently narrow bandwidth devices
with low efficiency.
The aim of this study is to design a microstrip patch antenna with dual frequency
response and improved impedance bandwidth. Among many available techniques,
stacked patch configuration is selected to introduce dual frequency response and
the substrate parameters are manipulated to enhance the impedance bandwidth.
Coaxial probe feeding technique is selected to excite the proposed stacked circular
patch antenna based on an air dielectric composite substrate. Professional
software is used to simulate and optimize the antenna response. The designed
antenna exhibited dual frequency response with a wider bandwidth associated
with the 2nd resonance. To achieve widening impedance bandwidth of the 1st
resonance, aperture coupled feed mechanism is used with a near resonant aperture.
Simulated antenna response was optimized to achieve desired results. Since
aperture coupled feeding technique is more feasible to implement an array
configuration, it is used to excite a two element linear array of stacked patch
antennas. Computational facilities (PC RAM) limited the investigation of larger
array dimensions.
The fabrication of the optimized antenna structure is carried out using Protomate
PCB plotter. An HP network analyser is used to measure the scattering parameters
(|Sn| in dB) of the designed antennas. The antenna measurement system, available
in the antenna lab, is used to experimentally observe the radiation characteristics
of these antennas. The measured data are used to corroborate the simulated results.
