Antennas play an integral part in wireless communication system.
Microstrip patch antennas are versatile in terms of their geometrical shapes
and implementations. Inhibiting characteristics of a single microstrip patch,
like low gain and smaller bandwidth, make it more popular for array
configuration. The aim of this work is to design and implement a microstrip
phased array antenna, printed on a composite ferrite dielectric substrate.
Four rectangular radiating patches on a low dielectric constant substrate are
arranged in linear configuration to achieve required radiation properties. The
microstrip array feeder network, consisted of integrated power divider and
phase shifters, is realized on an externally magnetized ferrite substrate.
Tunable progressive phase shift is produced by varying the magnetic bias
that changes the permeability of ferrite material, which in turn changes the
phase velocity and, hence, the insertion phase of the propagating microwave
signal. The four way power splitter is attained using Wilkinson type power
dividers, which improves the isolation and matching of the ports. The
antenna array is designed using standard equations and simulated by
professional software called, High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS).
Among many antenna simulators, HFSS is selected as it allowed the
inclusion of anisotropic ferrite material in the simulation process. The
antenna prototype is printed using the PCB plotter and manually transferred
on the composite substrate, which introduced some inaccuracy. Finally, the
simulated reflection response and radiation characteristics of the designed
antenna array are corroborated using experimental results obtained from the
Network Analyzer and the Antenna Transmission & Measurement System,
reSpectively. The designed array exhibited very close radiation response to
that of design objective.
