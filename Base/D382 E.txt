In this thesis a design technique called iteratively reweighted least squares(IRLS) is
used to design 1 D and 2 D IIR digital filters in the Lp norm sense. In this technique,
by selecting the weights in each iteration based on the error in previous iterations,
a solution to the Lp approximation problem is found by solving a weighted leastsquares
problem. In order to successfully design the IIR digital filters using the IRLS
technique a convergence control parameter is determined in a manner suitable for the
IIR filter design problem. A comparison of various 1 D and 2 D IIR filters designed
using the IRLS technique and the Davidon Fletcher Powell (DFP) unconstrained
optimization technique is also made, and the relative computational complexity of
the two techniques is discussed. Comparisons with some other recent techniques
both for 1 D and 2 D IIR digital filters are also presented.
