In this thesis, optimal design of variable structure controllers applied to different power
system dynamic problems is explored. Iterative heuristics algorithms namely: Particle
Swarm optimization, Tabu Search algorithm, and Genetic Algorithms are utilized in the
optimal design of the controllers. Two important power system problems (Load
frequency control and Power system dynamic stability) are studied in this thesis. The
proposed design of VSC was applied to single area, two areas, and three areas Load
frequency control systems both with and without nonlinearities and to a single machine
infinite bus bar system.
The variable structure controller parameters are tuned optimally to minimize certain
performance indices that reflect the objectives of the design. These objectives include
both improved dynamic behavior and reduced chattering in the control signal. Scaling
of the feedback gains in the VSC on convergence of the performance index or the
square of the error in the signal further reduced the chattering while preserving the
improved dynamic behavior of the system. Comparison with conventional design
methods for both problems using the new design procedure is also included in the
study. The study shows that the proposed optimal design procedure provides a simple
systematic way of arriving at the settings of the VSC with improved dynamic behavior
and reduced chattering. This method allows with ease the inclusion of nonlinearities
into the studied systems to realize an optimally designed controller. The robustness of
the proposed controller against system parameters variations had been studied. It has
been found that the proposed controllers are very little sensitive to these variations.
