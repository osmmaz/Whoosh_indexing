The objective o f this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness o f the coordinated design o f
power system stabilizers and FACTS based stabilizers to improve power system transient
stability. Three power systems are studied: a single machine infinite bus system with
First Generation (Gl) FACTS devices, a single machine infinite bus system with a
UPFC, and a multimachine power system. To estimate the controllability o f each
stabilizer control signal on the electromechanical modes, singular value decomposition is
employed. In each system, the problem o f designing all the stabilizers, PSSs and FACTSbased
stabilizers, individually is formulated as an optimization problem. Particle swarm
optimizer is utilized to search fo r the optimum stabilizer parameter settings that optimize
a given eigenvalue based objective function. Coordinated design o f the different
stabilizers is also carried out by finding the best parameter settings fo r more than one
stabilizer at a given operating condition simultaneously. To ensure the robustness o f the
proposed control schemes, the design procedure is repeated considering a wide range o f
operating conditions. To assess the effectiveness o f the proposed designs, damping torque
coefficient analysis, eigenvalue analysis, as well as nonlinear time domain simulations
are carried out.
