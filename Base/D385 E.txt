In this thesis, a telerobotic system has been designed, to allow remote control of a
robot arm existing in the college of computer science and engineering laboratories,
over the college network and by using a master arm that has been built locally. The
system is developed for situation or environment that are too dangerous or
uncomfortable for the human operator to perform, to keep him away and in a safe
place. The operator receives real time video streams from the robot side, and
accordingly he performs his work. Vision based master arm, based on un calibrated
stereovision to compute the three dimensional information of a geometric shape from
multiple views, have also been proposed and implemented.
