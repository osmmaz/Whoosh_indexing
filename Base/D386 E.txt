This thesis discusses the design of a variable gain transimpedance preamplifier with high
sensitivity, high gain, large bandwidth and wide dynamic range. Different preamplifier
configurations are evaluated and compared. The Automatic Gain Control (AGC) concept
is introduced. Also, the design of feedback based AGC for transimpedance preamplifier
is provided. The common base front end transimpedance preamplifier is studied in
depth. Solutions are proposed and simulated to solve a DC instability of this preamplifier
against the change in the feedback resistance. An optimized variable gain
transimpedance preamplifier with common base input stage is proposed. The usage of
Current Conveyor (CC) as a transimpedance preamplifier is investigated. A
programmable CC based transimpedance preamplifier is proposed. Finally, an AGC for
CC based programmable transimpedance preamplifier is also proposed
