Multi storey buildings with waffle slabs as concrete floor and roof systems are very
common in Saudi Arabia and in many parts of the world. Because of the complex
geometry of intersecting ribs, the analysis and design of waffle slab is not easy. Current
design methods neglect the existence of ribs and treat the slabs as solid slabs and are
approximate in nature. Finite element based methods are also used for design of waffle
slabs. Strut and tie model is being used increasingly for analysis and design of concrete
structures with pronounced D regions. With a grid of intersecting ribs, waffle slab
essentially forms a D region. This thesis presents a new approach based on strut and tie
method for analysis and design of waffle slabs. A three dimensional strut and tie model is
proposed for analysis and design of simply supported waffle slabs and to predict the
strength and corresponding mode of failure. The result obtained from proposed method,
generated in ANSYS software and analyzed using its nonlinear analysis features, is
compared with experimental results from literature. The strut and tie model is in good
agreement with experimental results for all configurations of simply supported waffle
slabs, whether the mode of failure is flexural, shear or slip bond failure, and it can be
employed for the design of waffle slabs. A Visual Basic based user friendly software
“STWAF” has been developed for analysis of the 3D truss model using STAAD and for
the design based on ACI 318 05 recommendations for waffle slabs using the proposed
strut and tie method. Parametric studies conducted using STWAF shows that ACI code
provisions for the rib dimensions and spacing of waffle slab is done in such a way that
the slab fails under flexure in case of overloading for spans up to 12m.
