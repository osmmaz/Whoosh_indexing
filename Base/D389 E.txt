In this thesis the design and VLSI implementation of a highly reconfigurable
Dataflow RISC Array processor (DF RISC A) is presented. This array processor
possesses all the features of static and dynamic dataflow models. It can execute
arbitrary algorithms (both recursive and regular), in static and dynamic manner. In
order to increase the speed and reduce VLSI chip area, a RISC methodology has been
adopted.
Each processing element can execute 25 instructions. In order to facilitate maximum
communication between PEs, each PE can communicate with its 8 immediate
neighbors using the boundary registers/ports, while it can communicate with the nonneighbor
PEs and the host using the communication network and the host bus which
runs between two alternate rows of PEs. This results in tighter coupling and faster
communication among processing elements. Since the topology can be reconfigurable,
it is possible to implement any dataflow graph on this processor array.
A ‘Global Network Controller’ takes care of the communication between PEs and
host. It generates control signals for data transfer between host and PE. A PE
can communicate with the host only through this communication controller. This
network controller is used to interface the processor array with the parallel port of
a Personal Computer.
The processor has been modeled at behavioral level in VHDL, and gate level im plementation
has been done using OASIS Logic3 Silicon compiler. Each processing
element requires 4261 CMOS gates with an urea of 7512 x 8081 p m 2.
