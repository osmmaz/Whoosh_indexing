With the continuous advances in VLSI technology, designing self timed
(asynchronous) digital systems has been gaining more importance. Self timing
solves several problems, e.g. worst case delay and clock skew, inherent in
synchronous designs. Although self timed circuits have several advantages over
their synchronous counterparts, designing self timed circuits is a much more
difficult task. Self timing requires a handshaking protocol between its modules. A
completion signal is generated by a self timed circuit to flag the completion of
computation. The self timed approach has been used to implement various
Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) whose performance is largely dependent on the
adder speed. Several self timed adders have been reported in the literature using  different teehniques in generating the eompletion signal. Hardware and delay
overhead due to the added completion detection circuitry are potential
disadvantages of self timed adders. With proper implementation, however, such
disadvantages can be minimized. The objective of this work is to design an efficient
self timed ALU that is based on a self timed adder using two Manchester carry
chains with completion detection circuitry.
