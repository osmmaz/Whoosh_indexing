Network planning in mobile telephony entails planning o f the supporting, switching,
signalling and interconnection networks. This is a particularly complex process,
partly because of the numerous intervening factors and partly because there are variable
environmental conditions which m ust be taken into account in order to provide
the user with a specified quality of service at any time. Given the intrinsic complexity
of the problem and the high volume of information that has to be handled,
network planning should be supported by good network design applications.
The problem of assigning cells to switches in cellular mobile network is considered
fo r this work. First, we review the process of the cellular mobile network planning,
the specific problem of cell to switch assignment, and few well known methods that
have been proposed so far. Then, we suggest a simple form ulation fo r the problem.
It should be noted that the cell to switch assignment problem is an N P(N on Polynomial
time) hard problem since the problem falls under the category o f the Quadratic
Assignm ent Problem (Q AP) which is a proven N P hard problem. A s such, no determ
inistic algorithms which can find an optimal solution fo r the above problem in
polynomial time exist. Thus we solve this problem using iterative heuristics to provide
solutions based on different heuristics and compare them with existing methods.
These methods are completely innovative form ulation o f the problem and involve application
of evolutionary computing fo r this complex problem that may be extended to
solution of similar problems in V LSI design, distributed computing and m any other
applications.
