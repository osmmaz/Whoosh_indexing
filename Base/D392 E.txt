Digit serial online arithmetic schemes are highly attractive since they allow suc 
cessive processes to be computed in an overlapping manner. This results in high
throughput operation with simple communication interface and reduced area over 
head. Decimal Arithmetic has an increasing importance and need specially in float 
ing point operations. IEEE 854 2008 standard for decimal floating point operations
was approved in June 2008. Since then, decimal arithmetic attracts researchers
attention. In floating point operations, decimal arithmetic is more accurate over
binary arithmetic. Simple floating point numbers (like 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) need an
infinite precision in binary while they can be represented accurately in decimal.
Many programing languages (like Java, C/C++, COBOL, and others) provide dec 
imal floating point support that occupies around 50 90  of their processing time.
A extensive study of decimal addition and multiplication algorithms is conducted
and presented in this thesis. This study shows that there has been no reported
algorithms or hardware implementations for an online decimal multiplication unit
to date.
In this thesis, a design of online decimal multiplier is proposed. The design has
two different architectures. The performance of the proposed design with both ar 
chitectures is studied and compared. Both architectures are modeled using VHDL
and synthesized for area and delay optimization.
