First a survey of principles used in designing
the principal types of solar radiation measuring instruments
is described together with a brief description of
the various factors affecting their calibration and
limiting their lifetimes. Then a theoretical analysis
of thermal effect in transistors is developed, with the
aim of designing an electronic apparatus for measuring
total and possibly direct solar radiation. Finally a
laboratory set up of such "transheliometer" is reported
along with the pertinent calculations and experimental
observations.
The major objective in this work is to assess
the suitability of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT)
as a radiation sensing device in order to meet the
requirement of designing simple, effective and economic
radiation measuring instrument.
