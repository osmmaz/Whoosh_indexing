Interactive curve design in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) is typically
accomplished through the manipulation of a control polygon. The methodology
based on B spline type basis functions results in a curve that lies in the convex hull.
Changes in the control polygon only effect the curve locally. This research is oriented
towards the representation o f interpolatory curves and surfaces, using rational cubic
splines. These interpolatory splines have been constructed through the D spline
formulation. The method fo r evaluating the rational cubic B spline curve is suggested
by a transformation to Bemstein Bezier form. The method uses the cubic by
quadratic functions and for given control points constructs the intcipolatory spline
method which enjoys all the geometric properties of B splines. Hence the spline representation
is not a spline over spline form.
The generation of interpolating spline curves and surfaces is a useful and powerful
tool in CAGD. Various methods have been developed to control the shape of an
interpolating curve for computer aided design applications. Some methods are better
suited for controlling the tension of the curve on an interval, while others are better
suited for controlling the tension at the individual control points. This work is
oriented towards investigating C 2 like rational interjjolatory splines with point and
interval tension. Shape controls are available to tighten the rational splines on intervals and/or at the interpolation points.
