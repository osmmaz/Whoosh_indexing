The thesis reveals results of research study on design and construction interface
dissonances in large building projects in the contextual boundaries o f Eastern province of
Saudi Arabia. To accomplish study objectives, the researcher carried comprehensive
literature review o f subject through periodicals, dissertations, previous research studies &
books written on professional relationships on project interfaces.
Initially the researcher carried out a pilot study based on survey questionnaire developed
through literature review. Pilot study encircles three large building projects, eventually
the validity of tentative questionnaire was evaluated and final questionnaire for survey at
macro perspective was organized.
Responses from (48) forty eight consultants and contractors were analyzed through
statistical analysis tool “STATISTICA”, the results indicate that lack o f coordination,
insufficient working drawing details, involvement o f designer as consultant, involvement
o f contractor as consultant & participants’ honest wrong beliefs are considered as most
important origins of professional dissonances on project design and construction
interfaces. Whereas the project management as individual professional service,
nationality of professional firms & involvement o f contractor in design phases are
interestingly revealed as least important origins o f dissonances between professionals on
project design and construction interfaces in large building projects.
