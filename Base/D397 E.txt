The most efficient equipment in which heat rejection processes may be realized is
the cooling towers, evaporative fluid coolers and evaporative condensers. This class of
heat rejection devices is defined as evaporative heat exchangers. The mathematical
models o f these heat exchangers are developed and validated against the experimental
data available in the literature, using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software, where
the maximum error encountered is 6.5 . These devices basically consist o f three zones;
namely, spray zone, packing/tube bundle and rain zone. The spray and rain zones are
often neglected even though in large cooling towers, a significant portion o f the total heat
that is rejected may occur in these zones. Therefore, the heat and mass transfer
contribution o f the spray and rain zones in cooling towers is discussed as well. A
param etric study is perform ed to evaluate the effect o f fouling (which is the deposition o f
unwanted material on heat transfer equipment), atmospheric pressure and mass flow rate
ratio on typical perform ance param eters such as effectiveness for rating calculations while
volum e/surface area for design calculations. Also, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to
evaluate the response o f the above parameters to various input variables such as inlet wetbulb
temperature, inlet process fluid temperature and outlet water temperature. Secondlaw
analyses based on exergy analyses are studied as well to investigate the variation in
second law efficiency o f these heat exchangers under different operating conditions.
Furthermore, the rate o f w ater evaporation under a w ide range o f operating conditions is
also presented.
