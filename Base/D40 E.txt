IN THIS STUDY, I HANDLED THE SUBJECT OF PAID DEPUTYSHIP AN ITS
APPLICATIONS IN THE QATARI FINANCIAL ORGANISATIONS. THIS
STUDY IS IN TWO CHAPTERS, THE FIRST CHAPTER STARTS WITH
DISCUSSING THE GENERAL MEANING OF DEPUTYSHIP AND ANY
RELATED AND /OR INTERFERING SEMANTICS THEN MOVES FORWARD
TO HIGHLIGHT THE ADVANTAGES OF CONTRACTING DEPUTYSHIP
THROUGH OFFERING A RANGE OF CONTRACTS THAT OVERLAP WITH
THE THE ORIGINAL ONE IN SOME PARTS. IN THE SAME CHAPTER, I
ALSO MOVED ON TO LOOKING INTO THE ORIGINS OF DEPUTYSHIP AND
STUDYING ITS DIFFERENT TYPES IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS WHERE THE
EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON THE PAID DEPUTYSHIP IN A SPECIAL
SECTION.
IN THE SECOND CHAPTER THE STUDY DISCUSSED THE PRACTICAL
SIDE IN TWO SECTIONS; THE FIRST ONE DISCUSSES THE INVESTMENT
ACTIVITIES IN THE BANKS AND THE SECOND SECTION DISCUSSES THE
SERVICE ACTIVITIES. IN BOTH ECTIONS, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE
HANDLED FROM A JURISPRUDENTIAL PRESPECTIVE AS A PAID
DEPUTYSHIP OR ANY OTHER TYPE.
THE STUDY CONCLUDED WITH SOME FINDINGS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS.FROM THESE RESULTS, THAT ONLY BANKING
INSTITUTIONS ARE ENGAGED IN PAID DEPUTYSHIP PARTICULARLY
THE INVESTMENT AGENCIES. HOWEVER, OTHER FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS DO NOT DEAL ON THE BASIS OF DEPUTYSHIP. THE
STUDY ALSO RECOMMENDED THE ADOPTION OF THE PAID
DEPUTYSHIP BECAUSE OF ITS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMIC
BOOM.
