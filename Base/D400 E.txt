With the growing trend o f computer graphics application in various fields such as,
Automobile industry, Aeronautical engineering, Ships designing, Mechanical
instrumentation, Animation, Fonts designing etc, it is desirable to have mathematical
representation o f physical objects in curve and/or surface formulation.
A lot o f research is done in order to acquire an optimized curve designing scheme. The
curves which are robust and easy to control and compute are o f more interest. O f all the
possibilities in curve designing, the cubic functions are the most powerful as they can be
used to define space curves and curves with inflections. More over these junctions are
easy and efficient in computation. The ideas such as end point interpolation, detection o f
characteristic points, least square approximation, recursive subdivision and
parameterization can be used fo r curve fitting.
