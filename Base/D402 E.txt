Plant wide oscillation assessment is one of the key research areas in process
control plants. Performance monitoring and control can impact huge economical benefits
to the industry as the competition and automation advances more. This work presents a
methodology for detection and diagnosis of plant wide oscillations. The proposed
methodology is based on routine operating data and detects the problematic control loops
by improved spectral factorization based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) search technique.
The advantage of proposed GA based factorization lies in its ability to search the solution
space globally. The proposed technique (GA based factorization), along with existing
techniques (Independent Component Analysis and Non negative Matrix Factorization),
are tested on two industrial case studies. Performance comparison of GA based
factorization with that of ICA and NMF verifies the improved and efficient results of the
proposed method for plant wide oscillation detection. Higher order statistics (HOS) is
used to identify the reasons behind the poor performance of the loops detected as root
causes of plant wide oscillations.
