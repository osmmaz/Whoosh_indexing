This is an experimental study on the dynamic response o f a rotor with a
transverse surface crack. The influences o f a non propagating and propagating
transverse crack, and side load on the dynamic response o f rotors were investigated in
order to get some clues that can be used to detect the presence o f a crack in rotating
shafts. Startup and steady state vibration signatures were analyzed using the Wavelet
Transform, a Joint Time Frequency Analysis technique. Vibration signals were also
analyzed with the conventional methods in which the results presented in the form o f
Frequency Spectrum Cascades and Waterfalls, Bode plots and orbits for comparison.
Two experimental setups, simply supported and overhang shaft arrangements, were
used: the response o f the two experimental arrangements under the influence o f crack
and side load was different. The results showed that crack introduces additional features
in the wavelet transform o f the startup signals and produces changes in amplitude o f IX
and 2X vibration harmonics at steady state. The results o f the conventional analysis
showed that crack increases the resonance bandwidth and may or may not excite 2X
harmonics during startup depending on the location o f the crack. Also, crack produces
changes in amplitudes o f IX and 2X harmonics and produces two loop orbit in the
steady state signals.
