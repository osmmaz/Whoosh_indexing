Till the present, electric utilities are facing the problem o f high impedance fault (HIF)
detection on electric overhead distribution feeders. These faults often occur when a bare
conductor breaks and falls to ground through a high impedance current path. Most HIFs
draw little current, which makes them difficult to detect by conventional overcurrent
relays. When such faults are not detected, they create a public hazard and threaten the
lives of people. The desire to improve public safety has been the primary motivator for the
development o f HIF detectors.
Detection techniques based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have shown a good
capability of detecting HIFs. In this thesis, a multi layer feed forward ANN, is designed
and trained with the Scaled Conjugate Gradient (TRAINSCG) algorithm to analyze the
current and voltage waveforms at the substation 13.8 kV bus and indicate whether the
feeder is faulty or not. In addition, the ANN can locate the faulty section of the feeder,
identity the faulty phase, and most importantly differentiate between faults and fault like
events, such as normal load switching, with a high degree of accuracy.
The Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) is used to simulate the distribution
feeder and generate the training cases for the ANN, which is developed and trained using
the “ Neural Network Toolbox for MATLAB® ”. The feeder parameters are selected to
represent a typical overhead feeder in the distribution network of the Saudi Electricity
