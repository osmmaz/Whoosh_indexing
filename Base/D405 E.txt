Prosody has been widely used in many speech related applications including speaker
and word recognition, emotion and accent identification, topic and sentence segmentation,
and text to speech applications. An im portant application we investigated, is
th at of identifying question sentences in Arabic monologue lectures. Languages other
than Arabic have received a lot of attention in this regard. We approached this problem
by first segmenting the sentences from the continuous speech using intensity and
duration features. Prosodic features are then extracted from each sentence. These features
are used as input to decision trees to classify each sentence into either Question
or Non Question sentence.
Our results suggest th at questions are redundantly marked in natural Arabic
speech and automatically extracted prosodic features can make significant contribution in question identification. We classified Questions with an accuracy of 77.43 .
Feature specific analysis further reveals that energy and fundamental frequency (FO)
features are mainly responsible for discriminating between question and non question
sentences. We found that Bayes Network performed better than SVM, MLP and
Decision Trees on our dataset. Removal of correlated features through Correlations
Based Feature Selection (CFS) produced more efficient and accurate results than the
complete feature set.
