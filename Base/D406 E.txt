Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is still the major process that deals with converting the
heavy portion of the crude oil into high value hydrocarbons. A considerable amount of
the global production of light olefins (Ethylene and Propylene) is produced through this
process. In this study, the effect of modifying the formulation of catalyst used in FCC
will be investigated at fixed temperature and different catalyst to oil ratios. Different
additives will be used from different families namely; MOR, Beta, ZSM 11, Ferrierite,
MCM, ZSM 5. Samples with different Silica/Alumina ratios will be tested as well as
desilicated versions. Different metals will be impregnated on different samples and
composites of different zeolites will be prepared and investigated.
The base catalyst of study will be a commercialized equilibrium catalyst (Ecat) obtained
from Japan and the gasoil feed will be PR VGO retrieved from industry. Bench scale
reactor will be used in this study, fixed bed reactor (MAT). Different techniques will be
used to characterize the catalysts. Activation Energies will be calculated for the best
olefins producing catalysts.
