This thesis discusses the main causes of failure in the Construction industry in Saudi
Arabia. A survey of 68 contractors from the entire Kingdom was undertaken. These
contractors were classified by the Ministry of Housing and Public Works from grade one to
four. The distribution of these contractors are as follows: 7 from grade one, 12 from grade
two, 27 from group two, and 22 from group three.
The survey included 34 different causes of failure and their degree of importance. The
severity factors of these causes were measured by their level of importance and were
ranked according to the severity index for group one together, group two, and group three,
and a combination of all respondents. A computer statistical package (SAS) was used to
analyze the data.
A hypothesis that" grade one and two (group one), grade three (group two), and grade
four (group three) generally agree on the ranking of severity indices" was tested and shown
to hold true. It was concluded that lack of experience in the line of the work, neglect, poor
estimation practices, bad decisions in regulating company's policy, and national slump in
the economy are the most severe factors. Also, it was noted that grade three contractors
give the most response, followed by grade four and then grade one and two. This reflects
the true awareness of causes of failures among contractors.
