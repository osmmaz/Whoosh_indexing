The use of the pulse pulse method has been used to calculate the very cohesive rock permeability in recent times
For ease and speed compared to conventional methods. Numerous studies have been conducted on the development of this method
And their uses in calculating the permeability of rocks very coherent but most of these studies did not include the use of this method
In the calculation of the permeability of rocks containing a crack.
The aim of this study is to develop a mathematical model to solve the problem of intermittent fluid flow
For compression during its operation at the full rock samples of the diameter containing the crack. Based on the results of the model
The athlete has been created an approximate device for the pulse pulses experiments on the full rock samples containing diameter
On a crack. The results can also be analyzed by preparing a computer program that can calculate the profanity of rocks containing
Based on the results of empirical measurements of pulse pulses using linear regression. It has also been introduced
In this study, a technique was used to estimate the permeability of rocks containing a crack of stress pulse tests.
