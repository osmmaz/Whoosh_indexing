Recently, there has been m uch in terest among researchers in the economics of
quality control. One of the m ost im portant areas in quality control is "process
targeting". The m ajority of the process targeting models in the literatu re deal
w ith single stage production system s. However, in real world in d u strial
settings, products are often processed through m ultistage production system s.
In th is thesis, a production system of two m achines in series th a t produces a
single product is considered. The product is assum ed to have two quality
characteristics, in which the first one is im pacted by the first process and the
second one is impacted by the two processes. Four process targ etin g models
are developed using different approaches for product quality control to
maximize the expected profit. The models provide the optim al param eters for
both processes. The first targeting model is developed for single sam pling
plans w ith error free inspection. The second model considers the effect of
inspection error on the sam pling plan. In the third model, a 100 percent
inspection is used instead of sam pling. The 100 percent inspection w ith
inspection error is studied in the fourth model. Sensitivity analysis is
conducted to study the effect of different param eters and inspection errors on
expected profit and optim al process m eans. It has been shown th a t the models
are very sensitive to the variance of the two processes, selling prices, and
rework cost and insensitive to the inspection cost. However, in th e case of
error prone inspection the models are more sensitive to type I error (rejecting
conforming items) th a n type II error (accepting nonconforming item s). A
realistic case study from local industry is used to dem onstrate th e utility of
the models.
