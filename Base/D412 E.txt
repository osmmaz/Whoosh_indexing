A computer program for simulating 3 D room ventilation problems is
described and employed to predict the mean air temperatures and velocities for a
number of realistic supply air inlet and outlet locations. The program,
TEACH 3D, solves the steady state conservation equations of mass, momentum
and thermal energy using a finite difference scheme, based on the control volume
approach. Due to the nature of turbulence, encountered in this research, the k  e
turbulence model was selected to transform the open form of the governing conservation
equations to closed form. The SIMPLE scheme was employed in the numerical
code to handle the velocity pressure link. The flow field predicted by the
numerical code are supported by experimental measurements done by others.
To decide on the effect the geometrical locations of the inlet and outlet has on
comfort, the computed results are translated into PMV indices over the entire
j occupied zone of the room. The PPD is also employed to render judgement on the
iI human thermal comfort response, such that if the PPD is less than 20 , then comfort
is claimed to be attained. In addition to varying the inlet and outlet locations,
the supply air temperature and velocity has also been varied for a particular
! arrangement in an attempt to achieve thermal comfort.
