Chlorinated organic pollutants are persistent, toxic and ubiquitously distributed in the
environment. These compounds are highly bioaccumulative and adversely affect the
ozone layer in the atmosphere. As such, its widespread usage is a major cause of
environmental and health concern. Therefore it is important to detoxify such compounds
by environment friendly methods. In this work, for the first time rice husk supported
platinum (RHA Pt) and Titanium (RHA Ti) catalysts were used to investigate the
detoxification of chlorobenzenes and Chlorophenols in a glass capillary microreactor.
High potential (in Kv range) was applied to expedite the activation of catalysts. The main
advantage of this capillary reactor is in situ generation of hydrogen for the detoxification
of chlorobenzene and Chlorophenols. Various experimental conditions influencing
detoxification were optimized. Reaction performance of capillary microreactor was
compared with conventional catalysis. Only 20 min is sufficient to completely detoxify
chlorobenzene and Chlorophenols in capillary microreactor as compared to 24 hrs
reaction time in conventional method. The proposed method is simple, easy to use and
suitable for the detoxification of wide range of chlorinated organic pollutants.
