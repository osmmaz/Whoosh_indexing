This thesis provides a model for concrete cost estimating in small residential buildings, and
a structure for maintaining a cost data base for the same. The model is a formalized
procedure to determine the main cost parameters.
To achieve this target, the thesis studies the inter relationship between the different
physical elements, or assemblies, of the concrete structure, such as footings and columns,
and the different basic items which the direct cost o f concrete consists of, these items are
namely: the form work, the reinforcing, and the concrete itself. The study covers the two
main cost segments of each of these items, these are material, and manpower.
This study was conducted by:
1  Personal interviews with professionals in the local construction industry, i.e., project
managers, site engineers, contractors, designers, and even the concerned construction
trades foremen and leadsmen.
2  Reviewing the specifications, standards, codes, methods and practices governing the
local construction industry, and the materials in use.The model itself consists of a number of mathematical expressions or formulas, that
describe and quantify the relationship between the structure element or assembly, and the
cost of the item basic components. Furthermore these formulas has been formed in a shape
of tables to be filled by the cost estimator in a systematic and quick way to conclude the
required cost.
The study took into consideration the different job conditions, and the possibilities and
alternatives that might face the contractor on site and worked out the formulas for a larger
area rather than only one simple direct state.
