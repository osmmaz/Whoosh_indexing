Zero length column (ZLC) method is used to determine the intracrystalline diffusivity of
aromatics in NaY and HZSM5 zeolite crystals and in NaY FCC catalyst pellets. The
equilibrium region of investigation is nonlinear and the slope of the long time asymptotic
solution of the nonlinear ZLC model is used to analyze the diffusivity data.
Diffusivity of 1,3,5 tri isopropyl benzene is greater than 1,3 di isopropyl benzene. The
desorption curve of 1,3,5 tri isopropyl benzene contains a kink indicating that this
molecule is possibly cracking into isomers of di isopropyl benzene and propylene. The
measured desorption diffusivity of 1,3,5 tri isopropyl benzene reactant mixture is
hypothesized to be the nonlinear co diffusion of isomers of di isopropyl benzene and
propylene. In pellets diffusion of 1,3 di isopropyl benzene and 1,3,5 tri isopropyl
benzene is micropore controlled. Diffusivity of 1,3 di isopropyl benzene and 1,3,5 triisopropyl
benzene in alumina particles is also examined. The alumina particle system has a log normal distribution, equilibrium is nonlinear, and diffusion appears to be macropore
controlled.
Diffusivity of xylene isomers in HZSM 5 is also accomplished. The measured and
reported literature diffusivity values are analyzed assuming a positive concentration
dependence of diffusion. This results in a satisfactory explanation of much of the
literature data when extrapolated to a zero loading basis.
