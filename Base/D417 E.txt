This thesis consists o f two main parts. In the first part, two optimal Hankel methods:
optimal Hankel without a D term developed by Bettayeb and optimal Hankel with a
D term developed by Glover, are applied to HR (infinite impulse response) digital filter design
and approximation. The results obtained from optimal Hankel methods are compared
to the results obtained from other time domain design methods: Least squares methods,
CF method, balanced approximation methods, and suboptimal Hankel methods. Important
conclusions are derived from this comparative study. Moreover, a slight modification is
made to one o f the optimal Hankel methods to improve its efficiency. The D term which is
neglected in this method is forced to be equal to the dc term o f the impulse response. This
improvement is shown by examples.
In the second part, the two sided approximation technique for HR digital filter
design is applied to the above methods. General formulae are derived so that any timedomain
IIR digital filter design method could be applied using the two sided approximation.
It is shown through different examples that this technique gives a very efficient approximations
to the desired magnitude response with low order HR digital filters compared
to the one sided approximation technique
