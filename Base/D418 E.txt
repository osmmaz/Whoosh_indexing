Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) based digital filter design algorithms are developed and
applied to the FIR (one dimensional) optimal filter design problem and FIR (one
dimensional) power spectrum estimation problem. The IIR (one dimensional) LMI based
digital filter design and IIR (one dimensional) power spectrum estimation problems are
formulated as linear objective optimization problems with LMI constraints and solved
using an alternative scheme to overcome the non linearity optimization formulation. In
addition, the LMI based formulation o f the filter design problem is applied to general
approximation/model reduction problems (SISO). The solutions obtained by solving
several examples show better results as compared with the traditional design methods.
