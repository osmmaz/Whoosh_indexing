Late Miocene Early Pliocene Hofuf outcrop is located in the eastern province. The aims
of this study are to determine the depositional environment, to build surface outcrop
models (facies and porosity models) using sedimentology, image the subsurface through
the Ground Penetrating Radar to detect the reflectors and image the face of the outcrop
via terrestrial laser scanning (LIDAR) and integrate it with ground penetrating radar data
to track these layers detected by the radar on LIDAR’s image.
