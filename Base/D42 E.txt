Thermal energy transport in thin single dielectric film as well as in dielectric dielectric
and dielectric metal, two film assemblies are considered. A modified form of the transient,
one dimensional Boltzmann Transport Equation namely, the Equation of Phonon
Radiative Transport is employed to model the transport process in the dielectric films.
Modified Two Equation model is used to describe heat transfer in the metal film. Effect of
Thermal Boundary Resistance is incorporated for the case of dielectric metal films. To
solve the relevant equations Finite Difference Method is employed. The study is also
extended to include the investigation of the effect of a high power, short pulse laser
heating of the metal substrate. Transfer Matrix method is used to calculate the laser
radiation absorption in the dielectric film.
