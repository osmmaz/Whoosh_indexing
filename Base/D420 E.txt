In this work, the pre distortion of nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) through the use of
adaptive estimation and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is investigated. After
studying the techniques available in the literature and proposing the use of some
techniques, it was found that adaptive filtering falls short of the desired performance
targets and subsequently, PSO was used. Several variants of PSO were examined and to
solve the dual problem of identifying the parameters of a nonlinear PA and estimating the
dimensionality of its model, two new PSO algorithms are proposed: 0 l Penalized
PSO ( 0 l  PSO) and 1 l ( 1 l  PSO) are proposed and studied. The
simulations performed indicate that the proposed PSO algorithms produce an estimate of
the model's dimension while maintaining comparable performance to the available PSO
variants.
