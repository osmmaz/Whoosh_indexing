In this thesis, a number of simulator circuits synthesizing capacitors and inductors
have been discussed. The programmable feature of the operational transconductance
amplifiers (OTAs) has been exploited to advantage to make the simulator circuits
voltage/current controlled and consequently controllable by the output of a digital
to analog converter (DAC). This results in digitally programmable tuned circuits.
The temperature sensitivity of the OTAs has been countered to make the overall circuit
tempemture independent (independent of the Vt term), resulting in Digitally
Programmable Temperature Independent Tuned (D iP TIT) circuits. The stability of
some of these circuits has been discussed to show how non idealities of active elements
play an important role in determining the performance of such circuits.
