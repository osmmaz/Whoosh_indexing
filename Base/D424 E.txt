The differential cross section o f 14N (d,a)I2C reaction has been calculated at 0.9, 1.0,
1.04, 1.1 and 1.2 MeV deuteron energies using Distorted Wave Born Approximation
theory. The calculations w ere carried out using finite range approximation for one
step process. In l4N (d ,a)l2C reaction, it was assumed that a deuteron cluster from l4N
nucleus is picked up by incident deuteron to form an alpha particle. T he calculated
differential cross section at 1.0, 1.04 and 1.1 MeV have good agreement with
experimental differential cross section. However at 0.9 and 1.2 M eV deuteron
energies the agreement is poor at some angles. This suggests that at 0.9 and 1.2 MeV
deuteron energies contribution from other reaction channels such as heavy particle
pick up and knock out should be considered.
