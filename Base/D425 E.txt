Recently a lot of interest has been shown in parameter estimation using ad hoc
wireless sensor networks. An ad hoc wireless sensor network is devoid of any
centralized fusion center and thus, has a distributed structure. Several algorithms
have been proposed in the literature in order to exploit this distributed structure
in order to improve estimation. One algorithm that was practically sound as well
as fully distributed was called Diffusion LMS (DLMS) algorithm. In this work,
variations to the DLMS algorithm are incorporated.
The first algorithm improves the DLMS algorithm by varying the step size of
the algorithm and eventually the Variable Step Size DLMS (VSSDLMS) algorithm
is setup. Well known VSSLMS algorithms are compared, then the most suitable
algorithm identified to provide the best trade off between performance and complexity
is chosen.
