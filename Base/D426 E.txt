In this work, a diffusion particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm
is proposed to cooperatively estimate a monitored parameter by the sensor nodes
in an ad hoc wireless sensor network (WSN). Here, every sensor node of a wireless
sensor network is equipped with a PSO algorithm to estimate a parameter of
interest. A novel diffusion scheme is used to cooperatively estimate the parameter
by sharing the local best particle and the corresponding particle error value
to the neighboring nodes. The performance of the DPSO algorithm is improved
by applying different enhancements to the PSO algorithm. Therefore, different
types of the DPSO algorithm proposed are: the DPSO algorithm with variable
inertia weight (DPSO VIW), the DPSO algorithm with variable constriction factor
(DPSO VCF), the diffusion modified PSO (DMPSO) algorithm, and a hybrid
DPSO LMS (DPSO LMS) algorithm. The simulation results reports a great improvement
brought about by the DPSO algorithms over the non cooperative PSOLMS
(NCPSO LMS) algorithm, the diffusion least mean squares (DLMS) algorithm
and the diffusion recursive least squares (DRLS) algorithm.
