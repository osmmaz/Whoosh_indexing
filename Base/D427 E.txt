In CDMA systems fine synchronization of the incoming and local spread spectrum signals
is crucial for overall system performance. The Delay Lock Loop (DLL) has been
traditionally used to achieve this. In the present study two different DLL architectures are
considered: the non coherent DLL and the RAKE like combining DLL. An extensive
study of DLL performance using analytical techniques is undertaken. The analysis takes
into account realistic channel conditions such as multipath fading and multiple access
interference. Quadrature phase spreading is considered in accordance with current
3G/UMTS standards. The statistics for the residual tracking error are obtained for various
channel conditions such as low and high SNRs, Rayleigh and Rician fading models, and
for various levels of multiple user interference. Finally, the analysis is applied to
positioning scenarios in a cellular network, where the accuracy of the signal time of arrival
(ToA) measurements between the Mobile and Base Stations plays a fundamental role.
