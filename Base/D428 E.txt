Arabic and Islamic related manuscripts represent a rich source of knowledge
that has been highly underutilized. M any Islamic manuscripts and scriptures, of
great historical values, are still shelved in various national libraries and universities
in Saudi Arabia (across the Arab and Muslim worlds). These precious historical
artifacts are yet to be typeset and published in book form. Although there are some
Islamic manuscripts which are present in digital form , they are generally not indexed
fo r retrieval purposes. Given the vast content o f these manuscripts, it is utm ost
desirable to develop indexing and retrieval system. There are various approaches
proposed fo r content based retrieval o f images, videos, and audios using low level,
intermediate level or high level features. Our m ain focus in this thesis is to propose
a framework of retrieval and indexing fo r hand written Islamic manuscripts which
are stored in the form of document images.
Computer aided retrieval and indexing system fo r document images is proposed and
implemented. Some preprocessing steps are first implemented to process document
images such as binarization, noise filtering and segmentation in order to enhance
the quality of document images. Second a set of features is extracted from user
identified words fo r sim ilarity matching purposes. Finally employing the concept of
a word book, the manuscript is indexed fo r later efficient retrieval. The prototype
system has been implemented and thoroughly tested fo r performance and found to be
able to retrieve sim ilar words stored in database.
