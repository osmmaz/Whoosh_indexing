The Khobar Aquifer is considered one of the important aquifers in the Eastern
Province o f Saudi Arabia. This research is devoted to study the lithology and
petrophysical properties o f the aquifer. Lithology was studied by analyzing rock samples
using X Ray Diffraction and thin section studies. A laboratory program was also executed
to determine the electrical propreties, the acoustic properties, porosity and permeability of
the Al Khobar aquifer rocks. Furthermore, seismic refraction and electrical sounding
surveys were conducted in the field. As a result o f these studies, general relationships
between ultrasonic wave velocity, resistivity, lithology, and porosity have been
established.
