The thesis considers the sensitivity analysis of the Dynamic
Economic Dispatch Problem. This involves the variation of the load demand
and the cost coefficients of the objective function. The objective function to
be minimized is considered to be the sum of the production cost functions of
the thermal units (already committed) in all time intervals.
The Dynamic Economic Dispatch problem is solved using a
redispatch technique. The latter is formulated considering the load demand,
unit limits, system spinning reserve requirement, security constraints of some
of the transmission lines and power rate limits of the units. The redispatch
technique linearizes the unit outputs about the base case static economic
dispatch (SED). The SED solution is obtained using a Quadratic Programming
algorithm in this thesis, although any conventional SED algorithm will be
suitable. After that the dispatch problem is linearized about the optimum
points obtained from the SED solution, a linear program (LP) is used to calculate the changes in the units output. The LP solution is combined with a
parametric program (PP) in order to be able to carry out sensitivity analysis
for the LP solution. In this case the LP solution provides dynamic information.
A static optimum solution will become obsolete as soon as parameters of the
LP model are changed.
The major contribution of this thesis is the application of sensitivity
analysis to the redispatch technique to solve the dynamic economic dispatch
problem. The solution technique combines QP, LP and PP codes to solve the
sensitivity analysis of the dynamic economic redispatch problem without the
need for solving a set of different LP problems.
