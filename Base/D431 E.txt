Developm ent o f suitable separation procedures for trivalent lanthanides from
actinides has drawn the attention of analytical chemists since the advent o f the nuclear
industry. Their role in the disposal o f nuclear waste to the environment was
recognized during the early years o f nuclear power production. Subsequendy, this
area received further momentum with the increasing application o f trans uranium
elements in industry and research. On the other hand, continued studies on the
properties o f lanthanide compounds have revealed their interesting application as laser
materials, as catalysts and as shift reagents in nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and magnetic hydrodynamics.111
Solvent extraction technique is one o f the promising methods for separation of
lanthanide metal ions. This technique depends mainly on the presence o f an
appropriate lipophilic anion, such as picrate, dipicrylaminate or thiocyanate, which is
easily extractable to an organic phase containing an appropriate ligand [2]. Thus, the
aqueous metal ion is transferred to the organic phase containing the ligand

forming ion pairs and the degree o f solubilization (extraction efficiency) could be
taken as a measure for the complex formation efficiency.
