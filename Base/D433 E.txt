Deterioration o f concrete structures is a serious problem in the countries
along the Arabian G ulf. Various repair techniques and materials arc
developed and used successfully in the western countries which have a
temperate climate. The aggressive environmental conditions o f the Arabian
G ulf countries which are completely different from the Western conditions
necessitate retesting and re evaluation o f these repair materials and
techniques.
Renovation and repair work w ill be a major challenge to the maintenance
engineers in this area. Before any repair/renovation work is undertaken it is
necessary that the repair materials be tested for their performance and
suitability. This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of a few
repair materials in resisting rebar corrosion. The experimental work was
carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the repair materials were
evaluated by conducting water permeability, chloride permeability and
accelerated corrosion tests. In the second stage, these repair materials were
used to repair reinforced concrete beams and they were exposed to sodium
chloride solution. The resistance to corrosion was evaluated by measuring half ccll potentials and corrosion rates o f rebars using Tafel Plot technique.
In the third stage, the effect of heat cool cycling on the corrosion resistance
performance of the repair materials and repaired beams was undertaken.
