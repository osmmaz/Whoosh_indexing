The durability performance is the most important subject that distinguishes the
good material characteristics from the bad ones, particularly under aggressive
environmental conditions. Concrete cylinder pipes (CCP) consisting of steel rebar
wrapped steel shell, lined with cement mortar inside and outside the pipes, are
manufactured in Saudi Arabia to transport water and other fluids. They are used above
and underneath the soil and are often subjected to chemical attack when exposed to
aggressive environmental conditions.
Durability of CCP is therefore a prime concern to users and producers. For
protection, fiberglass resin coating (FRC) is used on the exterior surface of CCP.
However, it cannot be applied on the joint, which creates a potential weakness, because
of the necessity to make it flexible and easy to construct at site. The assembled joint
typically consists of a Bell and Spigot system in which a steel plate is used covered by
diaper wrapped lean cement mortar for protection. For the protection of steel plate at the joint, three different types of primer
coatings: red oxide, zinc primer, and epoxy coating, were considered in this study. A
qualitatively assessment of durability was carried out for the assembled joint using the
three types of coatings to select the best performing one and the role of electrical
resistance of fiberglass resin coating, mortar lining, and coating on steel plates, in the
overall effective electrical resistance of main CCP section and assembled joint sections
was also qualitatively assessed.
