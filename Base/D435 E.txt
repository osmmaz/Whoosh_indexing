This Ph.D. thesis traverses two chapters which contribute to the study of star operations in
integral domains. In Chapter 1, we study when the dual of a t ideal in a PVMD is a ring
and we treat the question of when it coincides with its endomorphism ring. We also study
particular classes of overrings of PVMDs. Specifically, we investigate the Nagata transform
and the endomorphism ring of ideals in PVMDs in an attempt to establish analogues for
well known results on overrings of Pr¨ufer domains. In Chapter 2, we study the notions of
compactly packed ring and coprimely packed ring with respect to a star operation of finite
type. We extend well known results and investigate more properties of these notions
in different contexts such as Pr¨ufer like settings, Noetherian like settings, and pullbacks.
Particular attention is paid to the t operation as the often usual star operation of finite type.
Examples are constructed in order to illustrate the scopes and limits of the results.
