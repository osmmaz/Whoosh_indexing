A group of drilling rigs with different specifications will drill a set of wells that have different
characteristics; a schedule needs to be created assigning a specific set of wells to each drilling rig. This schedule
should be optimal or near optimal in terms of cost. Note that drilling rigs are not the same, but are different in
type, rating cost, moving cost, and capability. The same for the wells, as they differ in type, complexity, capability
production rate, distance to other wells.
To solve this problem, there is a need to come up with a standard and unified scale that will use these
different specifications and characteristics to come up with standard points. After that, analysis and studies of
different algorithms will be needed to find solutions for various problems, such as the lightest weight network,
job assignment, and matching. Finally the standard scale will be integrated with the proper algorithm to develop
an engine that can solve this problem.
This study sets out to solve a real problem in a petroleum engineering discipline, particularly in drilling
and production operation in order to substantially enhance the oil and gas companies’ net present value.
