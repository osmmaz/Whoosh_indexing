In recent years, a compelling need has arisen to understand the effects of distributed
information structures on estimation and filtering. In this thesis, distributed Kalman filtering
has been on focus with various perspectives. Firstly, a bibliographical review on
distributed Kalman filtering (DKF) is provided. A classification of different approaches
and methods involved to DKF has been elaborated, followed by the applications of DKF
are also discussed and explained separately. A comparison of different approaches is
briefly carried out. Focuses on the contemporary research are also addressed with
emphasis on the practical application of the techniques. An exhaustive list of publications,
linked directly or indirectly to DKF in the open literature, is compiled to provide
an overall picture of different developing aspects of this area. Secondly, an approximate distributed estimation within distributed networked control
formalism has been proposed. This is made possible by using Bayesian based
forward backward (FB) system with generalized versions of Kalman filter. The analytical
treatment is presented for cases with complete, incomplete or no prior information
with bounds and then followed by estimation fusion for all three cases. The proposed
scheme is validated on a rotational drive based electro hydraulic system and the ensuing
results ensured the effectiveness of the scheme underpinning it.
