The deactivation of 4A zeolite molecular sieves under severe hydrothermal conditions is studied. Accelerated deactivation runs are performed on Uetikon and TOSOH 4A zeolite pellets, and the results are interpreted considering their equilibrium and kinetic data.
A mathematical model for predicting the uptake rates for crystal particles partiallyblocked either due to coking or pore mouth closure is developed and numerical results obtained. Concentrated blockage of the crystal surface greatly reduces the mass transfer rate in comparison to uniformly distributed surface blockage.
Equilibrium data for fresh water on 4A zeolite pellets is obtained at 175 °C and 200
°C, and fitted to a dual site Freundlich Langmuir isotherm. The theoretical breakthrough curves are calculated using a dispersed plug flow model with mass transfer controlled by macropore and pore mouth resistances. The experimental breakthrough curves show a high degree of asymmetry between adsorption and desorption even at low equilibrium loading (less than 15   of saturation loading). This asymmetry' can be satisfactorily accounted for by the dual site Freundlich Langmuir isotherm.
Accelerated deactivated 4A zeolite samples are prepared at two temperatures. 350°C
and 400 °C, and two water vapor loadings, 0.05 gm/gm and 0.16 gm/gm for time periods of 100, 200, and 300 hrs. Breakthrough curves are obtained at 175 °C and 200 °C, at approximately 9.3 mbar inlet water vapor pressure, and the pore mouth time constant is obtained by fitting the experimental breakthrough curves to the theoretical ones. The pore mouth time constant increases with duration of deactivation, approaching a constant value as deactivation increases. The degree of deactivation is highest for the most severe and lowest for the least severe hydrothermal conditions. Uetikon pellets exhibit less deactivation than the TOSOH pellets.
