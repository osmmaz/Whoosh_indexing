Silencers with expansion chambers are often used to reduce noise in different
app lications such as HVAC, exhaust systems, and car muffler systems. This study
focuses on the effectiveness of multiple expansion chambers in reducing noise.Methods
for enhancing silencer designs are realized by utilizing extended tube s,changing
expa nsion chambercross sectional areas and changing the lengths of the expansion
chambers and connecting tubes. General guidelines for design enhancement are provided
through this study.
