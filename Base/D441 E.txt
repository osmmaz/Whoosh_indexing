In this thesis, mathematical modeling of Atom Transfer Radical Copolymerization
(ATRcP) was done in batch and semi batch reactors. In addition we modeled the
diffusion effects on ATRcP. The formation of Gradient polymers, a new genre of
copolymers, was also studied. Continuous reactors were also simulated for this novel
polymerization process.
The model was used to predict monomer conversion, average molecular weight,
polydispersity index, and copolymer composition as a function of polymerization time
and/or conversion. The model was also used to predict the distribution of molecular
weight, chemical composition, and comonomer sequence length at any polymerization
time or comonomer conversion. The simulations were helpful in predicting comonomer
composition drift and in designing products with specific chemical composition
distributions and comonomer sequence lengths
Dynamic Monte Carlo simulation was used in mathematical modeling and analysis.
The Gillespie’s algorithm was used for dynamic Monte Carlo simulation. Here, a control
volume is chosen and then the experimental rates of reactions were transformed into
stochastic rates. The probability of a reaction taking place was calculated to model the
elementary reaction taking place within the reactor.
