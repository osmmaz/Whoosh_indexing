Laminated composite plates are important elements in different structural applications
due to their high strength to weight ratio. They are exposed to several types o f loading
such as fluid loading. This type o f loading can be widely found in nuclear reactors and
marine structures. Other type o f loading is the one in which the load is moving. The
moving load might be a conventional vehicle, a loading airplane, or a tram. Studying the
combined effects o f the two types o f loading is o f great importance in order to fin d critical
values o f load velocity leading to significant vibrations, which subsequently lead to some
annoying or maybe failure problems. In the present work, Liquid loaded laminated
composite plates are investigated imder stationary and moving loads. Dispersion curves
are calculated under different liquid loading conditions. Transient normal displacements
are computed fo r 3, 6, and 12 ply laminated plates at three different locations along three
main directions, namely, OP, 45° and 90° direction. In addition, Group velocities are
compared along these directions. For comparison purposes, the response is simulated for
an isotropic plate at three different locations. Effect o f liquid loading on these responses
and group velocities is studied. For a single moving load, critical velocities o f the load
are computed fo r isotropic and laminated plates under different conditions. For double
moving loads, effects o f phase difference between loads and velocity o f the loads on the
maximum displacement o f both isotropic and laminated plates are investigated. A higher
order approximate solution in conjunction with Fourier transforms technique is used to
model the dynamic behavior o f the plate. This solution is based on the plate bending
theory, which includes the effects o f transverse shear and rotary inertia
