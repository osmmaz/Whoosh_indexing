The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical service in the Internet infrastructure,
and it provides user friendly name to Internet IP address mapping services. The
absence of the DNS has a severe impact on several Internet applications such as
HTTP, FTP, and or email that can cause such applications to become nonfunctional.
To avoid an intentional blocking from higher name servers, a dynamic
round robin P2P solution that is built over Chord protocol is proposed as a
secondary path to resolve the DNS queries. An evaluation of the proposed solution
based on load balancing, failure, timeout, and number of hops is also conducted.
Furthermore, the effect of joining and leaving nodes is also considered in the study.
