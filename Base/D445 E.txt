In this work, an echo cancellation scheme using a variable step size Normalized Least
Mean Square (VSS NLMS) adaptive algorithm is proposed. Many algorithms proposed
in the literature for this application were not given much attention in real time
applications due to their heavy complexities. The NLMS algorithm however, is given
much attention because it has a good balance between performance and complexity.
Conventional echo cancellers using a fixed step size algorithm, usually results in a
trade off between residual error and speed of convergence. The variable step size
NLMS algorithm presented in this work gives an improved performance, eliminating
such trade off. The step size variation makes it possible for the algorithm to converge
faster and at the same time, yielding a lower steady state error compared to the
one obtained by the fixed step size case. Derivations and analysis of the VSS NLMS
algorithm are presented and simulation results confirm the theoretical findings. The
results indicate that the VSS NLMS algorithm outperforms the traditional NLMS
algorithm both in terms of convergence and steady state error in case of low values
of the step size initializations. However, when high values of the step size initializations
are used, the VSS NLMS algorithm still converge to a lower steady state error
than the traditional NLMS algorithm, but with same speed of convergence.
