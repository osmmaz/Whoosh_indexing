Economic Production Quantity EPQ in its classical version does not include a scenario of
imperfect quality items. However, many researchers have considered this situation. We
consider a manufacturing process that generates non conforming items until proper
adjustment of the process is reached. The time to perform the adjustment is treated as a
fixed value and a random variable. Items produced after the adjustment period is always
conforming and the demand rate for the produced items is constant. The process stops
when the production of conforming items is sufficient to cover the demand, and then the
cycle is repeated uninterrupted. Other considerations such as maximum allowable
shortage, inspection errors, defective items processing and Taguchi’s quality loss
function approach are incorporated as extensions. We determined the optimal production
quantity and maximum allowable shortage that result in minimum expected total cost.
Data example and sensitivity analysis are provided for illustration and is expected to
provide more insights in managing this important problem.
