A lloy 800H T is a heat resistance m aterial that is used in high temperature industrial
applications such as steam/hydrocarbon reforming and ethylene plant tubes. Long
time exposure under these sendee conditions cause the alloy to undergo
m icrostructural changes. The alloy, in fact, is subjected to an in sendce aging
process. These in service m icrostructural changes, thus, among other effects, are
expected to have a pronounced effect on the fatigue strength o f this alloy. This study
explores the effect o f the aging treatment on the fatigue strength o f alloy 800 HT. Insendce
aging induced m icrostructural changes are simulated by pre aging the alloy
specimens p rio r to fatigue testing. This study has revealed that the inter granular and
intra granular precipitates, form ed during the aging treatment, have a significant
effect on the fatigue resistance o f the alloy.
High temperature aging is observed to promote the form ation o f coarse grain
boundary, twin boundary as well as intra granular Mz.iCf, type precipitates. These
precipitate particles were also observed to reduce the alloy fatigue strength by
prom oting the fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Compared to the temperature
effect, the aging time is observed to be not as effective in influencing the material
fatigue strength. M icrostructural examinations have also revealed that fatigue cracks
were predominantly trans gratudar in the crack initiation and propagation regions,
and with rough surfaces f o r the high temperature aged specimens.
