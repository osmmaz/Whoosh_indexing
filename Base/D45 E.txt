In this thesis, we derive the acoustic pressure formulations for the two layer model
with the sea bottom of smooth irregular shape. We also discuss the two layer model
with the non horizontal seabed and the depth dependent wavenumber for the more
general boundary conditions at the seabed. We also derive the mode coupling coefficients
for the same model using the modified mode coupling technique and also the
reciprocity principle. We also consider the stochastic model arising from the irregular
surface and bottom of the ocean and the volume and surface scattering coefficients
are obtained in this case for a random wavenumber.
