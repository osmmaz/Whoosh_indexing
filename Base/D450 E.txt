This thesis focuses on Economic Production Quantity problem. The EPQ problem
is concerned with the selection of the optimal production time for a production
process. The literature in the area of EPQ focused more on either the selection of
production rate or the production time. We have developed a mathematical model for
the selection of optimal production time in case the production rate shifts to a value
lower than the starting value for the case when this time to shift is deterministic.
The second model is developed for the case when this time to shift is a random variable
with known general distribution. The third model is an extension of the second
model to include the possibility of restoration of the system to the original production
rate in case a shift is detected during process inspection. The fourth model includes
the possibility of preventive maintenance to reduce the effective age of the system to
decrease the probability of shift. The fifth and final model extends the general model
by relaxing the assumption of deterministic production rate after the shift. Results
show that for the case where the production rate shifts, the expected cost per unit
time will be forced higher and also the system is forced to operate for longer periods
of time. The thesis is concluded by suggesting a number of recommendations for
future research.
