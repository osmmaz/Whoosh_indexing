Planning and reasoning have been a m ajor area of research in Artificial Intelligence
(AI). Case based planning (CBP) is one of the knowledge based planning
technique, which develops new plans by using its past experience instead o f planning
from scratch. CBP caches the solutions to planning problems in a case base and
provides methods fo r retrieving those solutions, whose problem descriptions are sim ilar
to a new given problem. The task of retrieving sim ilar cases (problem solution
pairs) becomes difficult when the environment is imprecise and uncertain, this makes
the whole CBP process complex. In this work, we propose a sim ilarity metric fo r
retrieval step o f CBP under imperfect environment. For capturing the imprecise inform
ation, we use fuzzy predicates to represent the initial and goal states o f a case
and a new problem. The sim ilarity between a problem and a case, computed by fuzzy
predicate based sim ilarity m etric (FDSM ), is dynamic i.e. sim ilarity may change
after problem solving episodes have been completed. This is because of weights assigned
to the predicates of a case and a new problem predicates. These weights are
updated/learned on the basis o f a feedback from plan repairer. In this work, fo r
simulation purpose, a fuzzy plan replay system is developed fo r computing the plan
repair effort.
