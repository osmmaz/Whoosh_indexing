The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of including
captive riders in mode choice modelling for intercity travel in Saudi
Arabia. To achieve this objective, mode choice models were calibrated
and validated using the intercity travel data of Saudi Arabia. The calibration
process was carried out in three stages. In the first stage, modechoice
models were calibrated using the data of choice riders only, the
choices being those alternatives as stated by the travellers. In the second
stage, mode choice models were calibrated assuming full choices over all
the alternatives available by the choice riders. Finally, in the last stage of
model calibration, captive riders were included in the travel dataset. The
calibrated models were compared with respect to their coefficient estimates
and other goodness of fit statistics.
It was found from the study that the inclusion of captive riders in
mode choice models resulted in increased significance of the coefficient
estimates which is mainly due to the increased sample size but decreased
the overall fit of the models. When used for prediction purpose, only that
model which was calibrated with choice riders data was capable of predicting
the mode choice of the travellers correctly whereas, the model calibrated
with choice riders plus captive riders was unable to predict the
mode choice of the intercity travellers correctly.
