This study w as conducted to investigate the effect o f castin g and curing
tem peratures on th e pro perties o f plain and blended cem en t co n cretes. T o achieve
th e objectives o f th is research m ore than 1200 co ncrete specim ens w ere cast. The
effect o f casting an d curing tem peratures on the com pressiv e stre n g th , pulse
velocity, and ab so rp tio n w ere evaluated up to a p erio d o f 168 days. F urtherm ore,
these tests were sup plem ented w ith pore size d istrib u tio n , X  ray d iffra c tio n , and
D ifferential therm al and therm ogravim etric analysis.
T he long term pro perties o f plain cem ent concrete specim ens w ere n o t affected
fo r casting tem peratures o f up to 50 °C, provided they are cured at 20 °C . T he longterm
properties o f b la st furnace slag cem ent co n crete specim ens c a s t at 2 0 and
35 °C and cured at 20, 35, and 50 °C w ere also no t affected. M o reo v er, these
concretes can be cast at higher tem peratures o f 50 and 65 °C, p ro v id e d they are
cu red at 20 °C. T h e long term properties w ere no t affected in th e silica fume
cem ent concrete specim ens cast and cured at 20 °C only. The lo n g  term properties
o f fly ash cem ent co ncrete specim ens cast at tem peratu res o f up to 50 °C w ere not
affected provided th ey are cured at 20 °C.
The prop ortio n o f coarse pores increased w ith an increase in the casting
tem peratures in all th e concrete specim ens. H ow ever, tem peratu re d id n o t affect the
pore size distrib ution in the b la st fum ace slag cem ents. This in d ic a te s th at these
cem ents can be b en eficially u tilized at higher castin g tem peratu res. T h e orientation
o f the transition zo n e becam e less preferential w ith in creasing castin g tem perature.
T he orientation o f transitio n zone in the fly ash cem ent concrete sp ecim en s cast at
50 °C was highly preferen tial indicating that these cem ents can be u tiliz e d at higher
castin g tem peratures provided they are cured at 20 °C.
