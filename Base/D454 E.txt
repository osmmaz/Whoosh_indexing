This study was conducted to investigate the effect of curing methods on properties of
plain and blended cement concretes. Curing of concrete is very essential for its strength
gain and durability performance. Traditionally, concrete is cured by water ponding.
However, the membrane forming curing compounds are also utilized for this purpose.
Though several studies have been conducted on the curing methods in general, the
performance of curing compounds, particularly under hot weather conditions, has not
been adequately evaluated.
Two groups of plain and blended cement concrete specimens were cast. In the first group,
plain, silica fume, superpozz, and fly ash cement concrete specimens were cured at 25 °C.
In the second group, plain and silica fume concrete specimens were cured at 40 °C.
The concrete specimens in both groups were cured as follows: 1  By covering them with
wet burlap, 2  By applying two types of curing compounds. The effect of curing methods
was assessed by measuring plastic and drying shrinkage, compressive strength, pulse
velocity, and water retention.
The two curing compounds investigated were efficient in moisture retention and
decreasing plastic and drying shrinkage strain. Although there was a reduction in the
compressive strength and pulse velocity, this was marginal. The curing compounds
performed well even under 40 °C. However, the performance of acrylic based curing
compound was better than that of water based curing compound. Therefore, it is
recommended to apply acrylic based curing compound.
