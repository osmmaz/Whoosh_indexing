Historically, extensive research was conducted in the degradation of phenol using
electrochemical oxidation process, which has recently achieved considerable success.
However, the process has experienced some difficulties mainly due to the species present in
raw water which hinder the degradation process.
The main objectives of this study are to optimize the operational parameters and to
investigate the effect of chemical species, present in raw water, on the degradation of phenol
using electro chemical oxidation process. In this study, a lab scale experimental reactor was
used to carry out the electrochemical oxidation of phenol.
The results showed that at 75 ppm of phenol concentration, 45 mA/sq cm current density and
6000 ppm electrolyte (sodium chloride) were found to be the optimum operation parameters.
The parameters optimization realized in this study was the main reason behind the success
achieved in the phenol removal and removal enhancement in the raw water. The results of
this study confirmed that only two species, namely, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium
chloride hinder the phenol degradation process. In order to enhance phenol removal, 1  of
Hydrogen Peroxide was added. This enhancement is due to the possible effect of the Fenton’s
reaction (AOP). This resulted in 25 minutes reduction in the process time. The findings of
this study are expected to contribute to solving the phenol degradation problem and
enhancing the environmental efforts of the removal of the industrial wastewater phenols.
