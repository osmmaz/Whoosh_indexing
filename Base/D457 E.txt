Under hot weather concreting, the primary cause of shorter service life of concrete
structure is cracking. Cracking of concrete is noted in many structures of the Arabian
Gulf where the environmental condition is characterized as hot weather. It could initiate a
number of detrimental processes that are known to be harmful to the long term concrete
performance. High concrete temperature at the time of placement is one of the reasons of
concrete degradation, especially under hot and arid environments. The cause of concrete
deterioration is also ascribed to the high differential between the fresh concrete
temperature and the ambient temperature.
To overcome the adverse effects of hot weather and to produce good quality concrete,
many local building regulatory authorities and international codes of practice including
the Saudi building code limit the maximum allowable fresh concrete temperature to
35C. However, there is no data to validate this limit. Further, the applicability of this
limit to blended cement concretes needs to be evaluated.
This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of water to cement ratio, casting
temperature and curing regimes on the compressive and split tensile strength, pulse
velocity, depth of water penetration and plastic and drying shrinkage strain of plain and
blended cement concretes. The blended cements studied were fly ash (FA), very fine fly
ash (VFFA), silica fume (SF), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and natural
pozzolan (NP) and used at the following replacements: at 30, 10, 7, 70 and 20,
respectively, by weight of plain cement. The plain and blended cement concrete
specimens were cast at temperatures of 25, 32, 38 or 45C and cured under moist
condition, covering with wet burlap or applying a curing compound. Plain concrete
specimens were prepared with a wc ratio of 0.3, 0.4 or 0.45 while blended cement
concretes were prepared with a constant water to cementitious materials ratio of 0.4.
