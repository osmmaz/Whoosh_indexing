Ethylene Polymerization was done to form Polyethylene nano composite with Nano 
Aluminum Nitride and Nano Silicon Nitride using zirconocene catalysts. Activity results
show that catalyst activity is maximum at 15 mg nano Ceramic fillers in both cases.
Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) results show that percentage crystallanity was
also marginally higher at this amount of filler in case of Nano Aluminum Nitride,
However in case of Nano silicon Nitride crystallanity decreases slightly with increase in
amount of filler. Results were also confirmed by performing WAXD (Wide Angle X ray
Diffraction). Thermal behavior of polyethylene nano composites (0, 15, 30, and 45) mg
was studied by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and Thermal Gravimetric
Analyzer (TGA). Morphology of the component with 15 mg AlN is more fibrous as
compared that with 0 mg AlN and higher filler loading as shown by SEM images. In case
of SiN morphology of the component with (15, 30) mg SiN is more fibrous as compared
that with control and higher filler loading as shown by SEM images. Micro calorimeter
(MC) results showed decrease in combustibility in polyethylene nano composites as the
filler loading increases. In another part of thesis blending of these nano fillers were also done with LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) and effect on thermal properties was
observed with different characterizing equipments like DSC and Micro calorimeter (MC).
