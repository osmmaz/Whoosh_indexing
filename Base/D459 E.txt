This study is an experimental evaluation of the effect of molecular
oxygen on the adsorptive capacity o f granular activated carbon (GAC) at
bench scale. Adsorption isotherm studies were perform ed for phenol and ocresol
under room temperature (23°C) and controlled neutral pH. Standard
bottle point technique was used for three identical sets o f bottles with
m odifications. A new procedure for obtaining the isotherm, denoted as oxic
procedure, is introduced where molecular oxygen is purged in one bottle
set. The second set, denoted as anoxic, include purging nitrogen gas for
excluding the oxygen. The last set dose not include any purging and only
the standard procedure, aerobic, is used.
Experimental results show that the presence of molecular oxygen
increases the adsorptive capacity of GAC up to 167  for phenol and 141 
for o cresol. These results were signified statistically using SAS program.
It is experimentally proved that the biological activity was not responsible
for the increased adsorptive capacity o f GAC for phenol and o cresol.
Therefore, a chemical reaction is responsible for this increase.
