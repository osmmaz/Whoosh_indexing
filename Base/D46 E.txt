In this thesis, New current feedback operational amplifier ( CFOA ) based filter,
oscillator and signal generator circuits were proposed In order to be compatible with
integration requirements, these circuits use minimum number o f active elements and
enjoy independent control of the critical circuit parameters. The effects of parasitics,
voltage and current tracking errors o f the CFOA on the circuit parameters were
discussed. Reasonable agreement between theory and measurements was obtained in all
circuits.
