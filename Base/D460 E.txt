Equal heat studies on phenol and acresol showed an increase in carbon capacity due to the presence of dissolved oxygen
The same phenomenon was found when oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide were used instead of molecular oxygen
While the study showed no effect of oxygen
The experiments have shown that physical adsorption increases at a low pH while the reactions increase with acidity
