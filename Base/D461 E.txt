This thesis discusses the role and practices of insurance in the
construction sector of Saudi Arabia. A review of the local policies forms,
clauses related to insurance in construction contracts and insurance
regulations were conducted pointing out strengths and weaknesses. Other
countries regulations were highlighted. Interviews were arranged and
questionnaires were sent to collect the data. The data were analyzed
concluding that there arc gaps in the regulations and deficiencies in the
construction conditions of contracts. The construction parties support for
enforcing the application of construction insurance was proved through the
questionnaire analysis. These necessitate developing a system to perform
those functions. The system, as suggested, consists of: guidelines for
regulating and enforcing application of construction insurance , developing
construction insurance conditions of contracts, and an insurance booklet to
expose construction parties to insurance and how to use it for securing
their interests. These are followed by topics for future research.
