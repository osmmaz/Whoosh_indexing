During the long term exposure of through Glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP)
pipes, material degradation is expected to occur in the matrix, fiber, and the fiber matrix
interfacial regions. The degradation rate may be constant or increase/decrease with time
and can be gradual and abrupt. Changes in the degradation mechanisms may also occur
during the course of long term exposure. All of these issues raise serious concerns
regarding the long term durability of the GFRP pipes and constitute problems that
require solutions before extensive use of the GFRP pipes in applications such as oil/gas
gathering and transportation networks.
In this study the effect of a variant natural and accelerated exposure conditions
hydrostatic burst and low velocity impact tests on the 150 mm diameter GFRP pipes have
been investigated. An in house hydrostatic burst testing system and an instrumented
impact tester were used for the testing. Pipe specimens of 150 mm internal diameter, 6
mm thickness and 1000 mm long were used for burst tests where as, for impact tests pipe
sections of 160 mm length were used. Pipes were exposed to selected environments
