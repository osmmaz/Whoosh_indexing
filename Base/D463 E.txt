During the long term exposure o f Fiber Reinforced Plastic (F R P ) pipes, m a terial
degradation is expected to occur in the m atrix, fiber, and the fiberm
atrix interfacial regions. The degradation rate m ay be constant or in crease/
decrease with tim e and can be gradual and abrupt. These changes in
the degradation m echanism s m ay also occur during the long term exposure.
A ll o f these issues raise serious concerns regarding the long term durability of
the F R P pipes and constitute problems that require solutions before extensive
use o f the F R P pipes is m ade to replace their m etallic counterparts.
The objective o f this research is to investigate the effect o f environm ent on
the perform ance o f vinyl ester and epoxy based glass fiber reinforced therm oset
composite pipes intended fo r use in oil and seawater transportation. In these
applications, the pipes are subjected to both static (design stress) and cyclic
loads (pressure flu ctu a tio n ). The effects o f wide range o f accelerated and the
natural environm ents on the tensile and the fatigue behavior were explored.
The accelerated conditions include D ry heat, U V radiation, hum idity, seawater
& salt w ater im m ersion, salt fog, and oxygen saturated salt water. The
fractographic analysis o f the specimens were done to evaluate environm ental
effect on the fracture process in the pipes.
