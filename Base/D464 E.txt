A bolted joint is a typical connection that is widely used in machine
assemblies, construction of structural components etc. Owing to the easy replacement
and installation, bolted joints are very popular. Bolted joint analysis involves many
variables like bolt size, diameter, member thickness, number of members, loading
condition, number of bolts and their different arrangements. Due to all these factors
the analysis is complex. Researchers have used different approaches like analytical,
experimental and numerical techniques. The analytical method requires solution of
ordinary and partial differential equations, which are not easily obtainable in actual
engineering problems. Experimental work requires more resources and time and it is
difficult to reproduce in case of any mistake. Because of these facts the use of
numerical methods is more practical and time saving. Numerical models can be altered
with ease and non linear behavior can be included if necessary.
In the present work finite element software ANSYS is used to perform a threedimensional
analysis of a single bolt joint. Finite element modeling (FEM) o f the joint
is discussed with boundary conditions in shear and tensile type of loading. Non linear
effects are included by introduction of contact elements at the interfacing surfaces. The
results are reported for different loads due to the applied displacements o f 0.06 mm,
0.08 mm and 0.1 mm, different clearances o f 0.01 mm, 0.05 mm and 0.5 mm, different
pretension o f 500 N, 9000 N and 30000 N and different coefficient of friction o f 0.1,
0.2 and 0.3. The same three dimensional model is extended further to four bolts to see
the effect of layout on the displacement pattern and stress distribution under shear type
loading. Experimental verification is done for the credibility of numerical results. A
tool in form of geometrical parameters to compare different layouts in terms of critical
bolt is also developed.
