This study evaluates the effect of formation damage on horizontal well
performance. A computer model in the FORTRAN language is developed in this study.
The model describes the fluid flow interaction between the reservoir and the wellbore.
taking into account the combined effect of inflow performance, wellbore friction and
formation damage along the horizontal wellbore. Based on the model, the effect of
important parameters on the horizontal well performance has been evaluated. These
include various skin profiles with different degrees of damage, reservoir height and
anisotropy and well length, diameter and open fraction. The results compare favorably
with the work available in the literature.
