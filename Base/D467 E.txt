Four XC Polymeric water based mud systems with different median particle sizes o f the
bridging additives were used to study the effect o f particle size distribution and flooding
time on formation damage. The experiment was conducted using Leak O ff experimental
setup. An Ultrasonic technique, a non destructive method was implemented to measure
depth o f invasion by the drilling fluid filtrates and particles on a Berea core samples. The
results o f this experimental work proved that an increase in the median particle size o f
the bridging additive would decrease the invasion depth and increase the return
permeability. It is also observed that as flooding time increases, permeability impairment
and invasion depth increased, which resulted in an increase o f the skin factor. For all o f
the drilling fluid types studied, the largest invasion depth was observed in the first four
hours flooding time. This is due to the absence o f well established, low permeable filter
cake to protect the formation from invasion by drilling flu id filtrates and drilling fluid
particulates down to colloidal sizes. In sizing particles in the drilling flu id system, it is
important to consider not only the invasion o f particles, but also the invasion o f
particulates down to colloidal sizes like the polymers. It is possible to achieve minimum
formation impairment by properly sizing the particles, not only to minimize the invasion
depth into the formation, but also to effectively filter out the smaller polymers and other
colloidal particulates in the drilling flu id system. An example is presented at the end to
show how this experimental work can be applied to horizontal well.
