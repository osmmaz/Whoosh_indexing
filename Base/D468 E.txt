Differential Electrolytic Potentiometric detector system is used in Flow Injection Analysis
for the determination of Cyanides, Residual Chlorine and different types of Acid Base
reactions. The method is rapid, simple, less costly and precise compared to other
techniques.The technique of direct current differential electrolytic potentiometry (dc DEP)
consists of polarizing two identical electrodes with a heavily stabilized current and
measuring the potential difference (AE) between them during the course of the reaction. It
is almost the first time that this type of detector is used in Flow Injection Analysis.
Univariate method was applied for the optimization of necessary parameters including
the current density, coil length and the flow rate. It was observed that when small current
densities were employed, the polarized electrode exhibited a sluggish response, hence the
resulting signal was relatively small. The height of this signal was improved on
increasing the current density but there are some limitations which do not allow to
increase the current densities above 20pA.cm'1. The residence time of the sample is found
to be inversely related to the flow rate and the coil length upto certain limit. The
calibration curve obtained on these optimized parameters having good correlation
coefficient between 0.975 to 0.999.
The main objective of this research is to develop an analytical technique, which is fast,
accurate, having minimum interference with other substances, by using simple, portable
and inexpensive apparatus, especially for the detection of those substances which are of
some environmental interest like chlorine and cyanides and Alhamdolillah it has been
achieved.
