Free electrons in metals can strongly interact with light to form Surface Plasmon Polaritons
(SPPs). The resulting electromagnetic waves are confined within sub wavelength dimensions
and can propagate along the metal interface. These waves can potentially be used in many
areas such as sensing, imaging, energy and optoelectronics. To efficiently utilize SPP
propagation, their relatively short propagation length has to be enhanced. Also, methods of
SPP modulation have to be devised. Efficient optical modulation of SPPs will pave the way
for great advances in all optical switching and miniaturization of on chip circuits. It will also
unlock the tremendous potential of nano scale propagation of SPPs for the possibility to
make efficient sensors to be applied in fields such as medicine and drug delivery. The aim of
this thesis is to survey the existing methods for SPP modulation and to investigate novel
engineering approaches to achieve efficient SPP modulation. The theoretical approach used
in the investigations is based on a numerical model recently developed using Finite
Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Various prototypes that can modulate SPP have
been simulated through the use of Chalcogenide (ChG) glass and noble metals. It was found
that the designed prototypes when pumped with varying input intensity signals were capable
of modulating SPPs by activating the nonlinear behaviour of ChG glass, thus paving the way
for fabrication of active devices.
