Effective control and monitoring o f a process requires sufficient information on the
state o f the process, which is uniquely specified by the process state variables. In
practice, online measurements o f all o f the variables o f a process are rarely available,
and in such cases, reliable information on the immeasurable state variables is obtained
by using the state estimator. This work presents the design, implementation and
application o f linear state estimators, which can infer the column composition from the
temperature measurements or other process states in a reactive distillation process.
The accuracy o f the developed estimators is checked by comparing the estimated
states to the actual states as predicted by the process model o f a reactive distillation
system. The robustness and reliability o f the linear state estimators are demonstrated
against erroneous initial conditions, the measurement noise and plant moclel mismatch.
The estimator based control system is developed and implemented on a reactive
distillation process. The control performance o f the system that relies on the estimator is
examined and compared to that o f the system which takes direct measurement from the
process model using online perfect analyzer. It is found that a robust linear state
estimator can be successfully designed and implemented on the feedback control o f
reactive distillation system.
