A Neural Network technique has been used successfully for developing a model
for predicting bottomhole pressure in vertical multiphase flow in oil wells. The new
model has been developed using the most robust learning algorithm (back propagation). A
total number of 206 data sets; collected from Middle East fields; has been used in
developing the model. The data used for developing the model covers an oil rate from 280
to 19618 BPD, water cut up to 44.8 , and gas oil ratios up to 675.5 SCF/STB. A ratio of
3:1:1 between training, validation, and testing sets yielded the best training/testing
performance. The best available empirical correlations and mechanistic models have been
tested against the data and the developed model.
Graphical and statistical tools have been utilized for the sake of comparing the
performance of the new model and other empirical correlations and mechanistic models.
Thorough verifications indicated that the new developed model outperforms all tested
empirical correlations and mechanistic models in terms of highest correlation coefficient,
lowest average absolute percent error, lowest standard deviation, lowest maximum error,
and lowest root mean square error. The new developed model results can only be used
within the range of used data; hence care should be taken if other data beyond this limit is
implemented.
