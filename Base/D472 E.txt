Composites are engineered materials developed from constituent materials; matrix and
reinforcements, to attain synergistic behavior at the micro and macroscopic level which are
different from the individual materials. The high specific strength, low weight, excellent chemical
resistance and fatigue endurance makes these composites superior than other materials despite
anisotropic behaviors. Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have excellent physical and mechanical
properties and alumium (Al) alloy composites have gained considerable interest and are used in
multiple industries including: aerospace, structural and automotive. The aim of this research work
is to develop an advanced Albased nanocomposites reinforced with Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
and silicon carbide particulates (SiCp) nanophases using mechanical alloying and advanced
consolidation procedure (Non conventional) i.e. Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) using two types of
aluminum alloys (Al 7Si 0.3mg and Al 12Si 0.3Mg). Different concentrations of SiCp and CNTs
were added and ball milled for different milling periods under controlled atmosphere to study the
effect of milling time and the distribution of the second phases. Characterization techniques were
used to investigate the morphology of the as received monolithic and milled powder using Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS)
