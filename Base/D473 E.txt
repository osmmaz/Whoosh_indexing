Congestion control is of critical importance for the proper functioning of ATM networks.
The congestion control issue is difficult because of the large bandwidth delay product of
ATM networks.
In this thesis, a statistical approach of congestion control in ATM networks has been proposed.
The statistical scheme operates differently from the previous congestion control
schemes. It takes into account the statistical nature of the sources when reacting to congestion.
It uses hypothesistesting to minimize the number of feedback throttle down signals.
Extensive experimentation has been carried out to relate the cause of congestion to
the statistical nature of the traffic sources. The performance of the the proposed statistical
scheme is measured through extensive simulation studies.
