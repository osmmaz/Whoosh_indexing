The air conditioning and refrigeration systems in the KSA consume more than 60  
of the electrical energy consumption of the building sector. Most of the used systems are
of the vapor compression type. Using solar energy to power such systems will save a
large amount of electrical energy that can be utilized by the production sectors such as
the industry. Hence, the focus of the proposed thesis topic is to develop a continuously
operating fully solar  powered absorption refrigeration system that can provide a 24 hour
service of refrigeration and/or air conditioning. The development will include an in depth
review of the design and operation of the conventional and solar assisted absorption
refrigeration systems, analysis of refrigerant absorbent solutions for solar powered
systems, coming up with new alternative designs, detailed thermodynamic analysis of
some of the new alternative designs, selection of the most suitable alternative design and
finally preparation of the working drawings for a model of the selected design.
