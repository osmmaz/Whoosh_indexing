In Bus thesis, the idea o f integrating personal computers (PC’s) and d istal signal
processing boards (DSP) to acquire and analyze the electrocardio^aphlc (ECG) sisals is
achieved. The main part o f the thesis is concerned with acquiring data from the ECG
leads. A hardware design which consists of the signal interfacing and conditioning is
developed and implemented. Moreover, the hardware desigi is integrated with a software
package that uses both high and low level languages for the acquisition and analysis of the
signal. This is performed by using a digital signal processing board called DSP 32C A
study about the heart as a physiological organ is performed too. Moreover, a survey of
some methods analyzing the ECG signal and extracting its features is done. An
investigation of applying these methods to our study is performed in order to get the values
ofQ RS, PT, QT waves and the heart rate. In addition, a complete study of how the digital
signal processing (DSP) board DSP 32C and its main CPU DSP32C chip is performed.
Integrated with Assembly language of the DSP 32C board, C Ianguage is used as the main
program m ing language on this board in order to acquire and analyze the ECG signals.
