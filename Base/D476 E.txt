In this research work we developed a highly sensitive analytical Laser Induced Breakdown
Spectrometer to detect toxic elements in commercially available cosmetic products. These
products are frequently used by many all over the world, therefore there is an increasing demand
to determine concentration levels of toxic elements present in them because they cause
dangerous diseases and most of them are highly carcinogenic and life threatening. Laser Induced
Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied for spectroscopic analysis of cosmetic products
such as tooth paste, synthetic hair dye, kohl eyeliners and talcum powder samples. These
samples were purchased from the local market within the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The LIBS
method is based on spectroscopic analysis of plasma resulting from the interaction of a high
power pulsed laser radiations with a sample medium. In order to improve the sensitivity of the
spectrometer, the dependence of the LIBS signal intensity and plasma parameters such as
temperature (T) and electron density (ne) on gate/time delay, laser fluence and wavelength of the
excitation source for plasma generated under ambient conditions were studied. During this work
Nd: YAG lasers having 266nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm wavelengths operating in Q switch mode
were used as the excitation sources in combination with a spectrograph having a gated ICCD
camera. Boltzmann plots and stark broadening for the recorded spectral lines were used to estimate the plasma temperature and electron density respectively. Temporal evolution of the
plasma temperature and electron density showed a t 2 dependence. On the other hand plasma
temperature and electron density increased with increase in laser fluence but leveled off at higher
fluencies.
