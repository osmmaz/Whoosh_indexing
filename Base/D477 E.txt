Disputes are common in the construction industry. Several methods exist for dispute
resolution between the parties of the contract ranging from informal negotiation to legal
litigation. This study addresses various dispute resolution methods and their advantages
and disadvantages. Relative importance of factors considered in selecting a dispute
resolution method along with the preferred method is determined by conducting a survey
with twenty one (21) large contractors, twenty seven (27) eminent consultants and twenty
two (22) owners (project managers representing owner organizations) in the Eastern
Province of Saudi Arabia. The top most influencing factors identified were obtaining
fairness, contract obligations, bindingness of the decision, cost of the process and type of
dispute (majorVninor). Another objective of this research was to develop an AHP
(Analytical hierarchy process) based model for the systematic selection of appropriate
dispute resolution method using the preferences of factors provided by the end user. An
AHP model was developed based on the results of the questionnaire survey as well as
survey of the literature. Application of the model was Discussed via a hypothetical
example utilizing the AHP based software, Expert Choice. This model will serve as a
tool in selection of the appropriate dispute resolution methods for the Construction
Industry.
