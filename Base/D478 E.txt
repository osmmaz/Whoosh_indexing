The objectives of this thesis are to develop a model for assessing the potential of
buildings for temporary use as transitional shelters; to conduct case studies to
demonstrate and verify the applicability of the developed model and to develop
guidelines for use by design professionals to facilitate the provision of buildings that
could be easily adapted for temporary use. In order to achieve these objectives, literature
review and interviews with professional who have worked in the disaster relief and
displaced settlement have been conducted. The obtained knowledge and experiences
were the foundation to develop a multi criteria model that includes sequential phases to
assess the buildings’ potential for temporary use. These phases are planning constraints
profile, preliminary assessment of building condition, comprehensive assessment of
building condition, data analysis and report development. To verify and check the model
applicability, the model is applied on two case studies, for buildings that were used as
transitional shelters in Hadramout, Yemen during the 2008 flood disaster. The outcome
of applying the developed model on these cases presents a variation in the buildings’
potential and their capacity. In addition, a set of constraints and recommendations were
concluded to optimize the use of these buildings temporarily as transitional shelters. By
comparing these results with the case studies records, the outcome of the model is very
rational and reflects the actual capability and condition of these buildings. Finally, the
research presents a set of guidelines and recommendations for use by design
professionals to assess the potential of buildings that could be easily adapted for
temporary use.
