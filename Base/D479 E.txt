The piecewise polynomial B spline representation is a flexible tool in CAGD for
representing and designing the geometric objects. In the field of Computer Graphics
or Computer Aided Design, a very useful property fo r a given spline model is to
have locally supported basis functions, in order to allow localized modifications of the
shape. Unfortunately this property can also become a serious disadvantage when the
user wishes to edit the global shape of a complex object. Multiresolution representation
is proposed as a solution to alleviate this problem. Various multiresolution
methods are proposed fo r different B spline models.
In our work, we propose a multiresolution representation for NURBS (Non 
Uniform Rational B Spline). Among the types of B splines, NURBS have been receiving
considerable attention in the areas of computer graphics and geometric modeling.
The proposed multiresolution model uses control point decimation strategy for
decomposition of NU RBS curves. It is extended to represent using multiresolution
the NURBS surfaces. Our proposed method is efficient in both time and space utilization.
This work makes a comparative study of our proposed method and two of the
already existing multiresolution representation methods for B splines, one that uses
the B spline wavelets and the other is based on knot decimation and least squares
approximation strategy.
