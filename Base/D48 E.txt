The reduction o f a commercial Ni/yAl20 3 catalyst was carried oat at temperature
ranged from 250 to 500 °C and for duration from 2 to 16 hours. The effects o f reduction
conditions on the activity and selectivity of Ni/yAI20 3 were studied for a methanation
reaction in a gradientless Berty reactor. These effects were used to determine optimal
reduction conditions o f the catalyst. The optimal reduction conditions are: temperature
30(TC, duration 8 hrs, space velocity 3000 h r 1, and heating rate o f bed 5°C/min.
The reaction rates were measured by injecting a feed containing H2 (26 m ol  ), CO
(6.7 mol ), and the balance being nitrogen. The product stream contained
II2, N2, CO, CH4, and small amounts of C 0 2 gas. The operating temperature and
pressure of the reaction were kept constant at 350 °C, and 30 psig, respectively. The flow
rate o f the feed was kept constant at 600 ml/min and 10 gm. o f catalyst was charged for
each run.
The. catalyst used was a commercial NifyAl20 3 (C13 4 04) containing 20  Ni
supported on yAl20 3 ; manufactured by UCI (United Catalyst Inc.) and supplied by
SA M AD Fertilizer Co. Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia.
The effects o f speed o f impeller on the rate of methanation were studied and it was
found that mass transfer limitations disappeared at a speed of 786 rpm.
The effects o f space time, H^CO ratio, and pressure on the activity and selectivity of
the catalyst were studied. It is found that by increasing the space time, the activity
decreases while selectivity to CH4 formation increases from 90 to 96 . Use of higher
II2I CO ratio (3.0 6.5) improves selectivity up to 98  ^ but decreases the rate of
methanation. Lower H J CO ratio (3.0 I.0) increases rate of CO conversion but
decreases both the selectivity and the rate of CH4 production. Reaction pressure
apparently has an insignificant effect on the activity of catalyst. However, improvement in
the selectivity is observed.
