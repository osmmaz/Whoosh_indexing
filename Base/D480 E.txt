Excessive water production from petroleum reservoirs has been a serious problem. Polymer gel
is one of the common successful treatments. In this study, cheap polyacrylamide (PAM)
polyethylenimene (PEI) gel system was developed for use at high temperature applications. The
effect of salts on PAM degree of hydrolysis was studied by using NaCl and NH4Cl. These salts
showed good compatibility with field mixing water whereas, NaCO3 (a high effective retarder)
was observed to form a white precipitate with PAM / PEI at high temperatures. 13C NMR and
DSC revealed that NH4Cl increased PAM degree of hydrolysis more compared to NaCl.
Rheological measurements showed that NH4Cl decrease the viscosity of the hydrolyzed PAM.
The cross linking retardation was concluded to be due to charge shielding effect rather than
deceased PAM hydrolysis. The strength of PAM / PEI was examined through dynamic
measurements taking into account different parameters like temperature, polymer and crosslinker
concentrations, initial pH, salinity, salt (retarder) effect. The gelation kinetics was studied
by DSC and modeled using rate based processes. The developed PAM / PEI gel system was
evaluated in sandstone and carbonate cores at high temperature (150oC) and pressure (1000 psi).
A reduction in permeability of about 94  was obtained in sandtone core. In the carbonate core,
about 99.8  permeability reduction was achieved by PAM / PEI at the same conditions. The proposed PAM/PEI system proved to provide satisfactory gel strength at high temperature using
field water.
