Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is considered as one of the advanced Non Destructive
Testing (NDT) methods with many applications. In this method, electromagnetic wave is
transmitted into materials’ surfaces then the reflected signals are interpreted to know the
materials properties and their internal content. However, one of the limiting factors of the
GPR usefulness is the difficulty associated with received signals interpretation. For GPR
system to be effective, there is a need to understand the contribution of different materials
properties on the EM wave propagation to extract reliable information from the received
signals. The interpretation errors can be minimized once a reliable GPR simulation
system with precise materials models is used.
In this thesis, we develop an advanced GPR simulation system using the general
polarization FDTD ADE algorithm. The developed algorithm is capable of simulating
two and three dimensional GPR signal propagation through lossy, electric and/or
magnetic dispersive or non dispersive materials. The developed algorithm was validated
against previous developed algorithm and analytical solution with excellent agreement.
Several cases for different dispersive systems with recent material models were
presented.The extracted simulation results were processed using Time Frequency
analysis. General characteristics features have been identified for different wet soil
moisture percentages.
