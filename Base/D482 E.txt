Saudi Arabia is witnessing an unprecedented development in many aspects. Most of this
development is realized in the construction industry. The large facilities require extensive
maintenance programs in order to keep them in good running conditions as originally
intended. The purpose of this research is to formalize the development of an assessment
tool for maintenance management for facilities of public schools in Saudi Arabia. The
methodology adopted in this research consists of two parts. The first part employs the
holistic system approach to maintenance to identify quality criteria for incorporation in
the developed assessment tool. This part uses ISO 9001:2000 standards, extensive
literature review and in addition a series of interviews with experts in maintenance. The
second part involves the assessment of the identified quality criteria through conducting
in depth, well structured surveys of experts in the maintenance of large public
organizations. Based on the results obtained from the assessment, the assessment tool has
been developed and applied to evaluate the current practice in three case studies to test its
practicality. The significance of this study stems from the fact that at the current time
there is no such assessment tool in Saudi Arabia and it is expected to help in prolonging
the life span of such public facilities. In addition, using such an assessment tool
consistently will assist in improving the safety of occupants, providing a high level of
satisfaction for users of these facilities, providing healthy and safe environment to
improve productivity levels, and increasing the protection of the investment in public
facilities.
