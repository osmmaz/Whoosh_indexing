Determination of organic contaminates in water samples required tedious sample
preparation prior to instrumental analyses. Most of the environmental contaminants are
present at trace level concentrations; thus, multi step conventional sample preparation
methods lead to poor quantization. In this regards, this thesis is focused on the
development of automated analytical methodologies for water samples. To achieve
complete automation, different strategies were adopted to automate the entire analytical
procedure without any human intervention. For the first time, solvent minimized
dispersive liquid liquid microextraction (DLLME) and solvent less solid phase
microextraction techniques (SPME) were developed and integrated the extraction using
CTC CombiPal autosampler coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Chapter 2 and 5 are dedicated for DLLME/GC MS analytical technique while chapter 3,
4 and 6 are focused on SPME/GC MS methods.
