Relative permeability data are essential for almost all calculations of
fluid flow in petroleum engineering. Water oil relative permeability curves play
important roles in characterizing the simultaneous two phase flow in porous
rocks and predicting the performance of immiscible displacement processes in
oil reservoirs. New empirical equations were developed in this study to
calculate water oil imbibition relative permeability curves for sandstones based
on a total of 827 experimentally obtained data points from 46 displacement core
tests. The relative permeability models were derived as a function of rock and
fluid properties using stepwise linear and nonlinear regression analyses. The
new empirical equations were both evaluated using the data utilized in the
development and validated using published data, against previously published
equations. Statistical results show that the empirical equations developed in this
study outperform all previous empirical equations, for both the data used in the
development and validation.
