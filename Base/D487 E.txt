Analysis of trace level contaminants in complex matrices, such as food, often requires
an extensive sample preparation prior to instrumental analysis. The typical steps
involved in the sample preparation include sampling/homogenisation, extraction,
clean up and pre concentration followed by the final analysis. In this context, we
developed two simple analytical methods for the determination of organophosphorus
pesticides (OPPs) and biogenic amines (BAs) in food matrices using two simple
extraction techniques.
