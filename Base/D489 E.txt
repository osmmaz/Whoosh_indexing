The lack of cost data in Saudi construction industry is one of the main causes of projects’
poor cost estimation that results in contractors failures especially residential buildings’
contractors.
This research develops a cost data model for preparation of detailed estimates of
mechanical works in residential buildings. The mechanical works include plumbing and
heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) for small size villa or two (2) storey
building consisting of four (4) apartments.
The research utilized the assembly estimate method of MEANS Cost Data Book published
in the United States as a basis for the development of the model. The method considers all
the system components as one work package or assembly.
The research began by identifying the mechanical works’ systems and assemblies available
in residential buildings. Next, interviews were performed for data collection of material cost, labor productivity and contractors’ current estimating practices. A simple
mathematical relationship was developed to calculate the costs of material, labor,
equipment, overhead and profit.
The data was collected through interviews with selected firms and personnel who can
contribute to the research through their expertise such as equipment and material suppliers,
project managers, engineers and tradesmen.
The research focused on Dammam Metropolitan Area which is located in the Eastern
Province of Saudi Arabia.
