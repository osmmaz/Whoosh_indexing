With the growth of the Internet, the Internet traffic increases, burdening the
available network resources. The Internet service providers (ISPs) that maintain
the networks try to lessen the load on the resources by implementing new technologies,
by efficient utilization of the available resources, or both. The ISPs ensure
proper routing of the packets resulting in effective utilization and a reduced load on
their resources. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is the most popular and most
widely used protocol for routing in the intra domain networks. OSPF selects the
path of the packet based on the weight of the links. The OSPF Weight Setting problem
(OSPFWS) is to find a set of weights that when applied to the links, given
a traffic demand, provide a better network performance. OSPFWS is an NP hard
problem. An approach to the OSPFWS using Tabu Search (TS) already exists. The
TS approach focusses on generating optimized solutions based only on the traffic demand,
network topology, and link capacity. However, the solutions generated take a
lot of time to obtain and are applied offline. Therefore, an approach to OSPFWS
is proposed which can be used online. The objective of the thesis is to investigate
and implement different online simulation system approaches using Tabu Search.
To study the effects of assigning solution weights of different demands to a given
demand at hand and to improve these weights to suit this demand also contributes
towards the thesis work. To formulate a deterministic approach that improves the
existing initial solution weights to suit the demand at hand is also part of this thesis
work.
