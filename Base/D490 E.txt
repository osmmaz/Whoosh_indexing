Low activity of the methanol electro oxidation catalysts and poisoning of the catalysts by
intermediate organic compounds produce during the reaction is one of the biggest
challenges facing the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) technology. In this work, several
catalysts were prepared for methanol electro oxidation. In the first part, performance of
PtRu catalysts supported on mesoporous carbon nitrides (MCN) was studied and
compared with the performance of PtRu supported on Vulcan XC 72 and multi walled
carbon nanotubes. The MCN was synthesized using SBA 15 as a template with different
aging temperatures of 100, 130 and 150 °C. The Pt Ru/MCN 150 catalyst showed the
highest activity, about 30  more than that of the commercial Pt Ru/C (E TEK).
In the second part, a novel approach was used to prepare Pt Ru/Fe2O3 MC, Pt Ru/CoOMC
and Pt Ru/NiO MC catalysts by synthesizing high surface area Fe2O3 MC, CoO MC
and NiO MC and then followed by impregnation with PtRu. The Pt Ru/NiO MC catalyst
showed the highest activity, about 18  greater than the commercial Pt Ru/C (E TEK).
In the third part, Pt/CeO2 MC, Pt/PrO2 MC, Pt/NdO2 MC, and Pt/SmO2 MC catalysts
were prepared by synthesizing high surface area CeO2 MC, PrO2 MC, NdO2 MC, and
SmO2 MC, followed by impregnation with Pt. The Pt/CeO2 MC catalyst showed the
highest activity, about 3.5  more than that of the commercial Pt Ru/C (E TEK) catalyst.
All the prepared catalysts showed reasonable stability. The metal nano oxides & catalysts
were characterized using FESEM, BET surface area, FT IR, UV Vis, EDS and XRD.
Finally, from the cyclic voltammetric results, Pt Ru/MCN150, Pt Ru/MCN130, Pt 
Ru/MCN100, Pt Ru/F MWCNTs, Pt Ru/Vulcan XC 72, and Pt Ru/C (E TEK) were
selected and used to fabricate membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). The MEAs were
tested in a practical DMFC. The MEA in which Pt Ru/MCN150 was used as the anode
catalyst showed the highest power density of 56.3 mW/cm2 at 80 °C.
