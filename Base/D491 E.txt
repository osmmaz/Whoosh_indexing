Ceramic membranes are the permselective barriers usually made from
ceramic materials such and zeolites. Layer thickness, pore
size and amount of porosity are the key elements that govern the fabrication of ceramic
membranes. The aim of this research is to explore the development of ceramic based
multilayer membrane of porous structure with gradient porosity for potential filtration
and purification applications. Disc shaped macro porous alumina support was fabricated
by powder metallurgy technique
