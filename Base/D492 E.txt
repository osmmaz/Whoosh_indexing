Organochlorines pesticides (OCPs) is a class of pesticides that have been prohibited worldwide
since the beginning of 1980s due to their toxicity, stability, high liposolubility, long biological
half life, and consequently a high degree of bioaccumulation in food chain. The pollutants can be
transferred to animals from either the surrounding environment or from diets. Also, the lipid
content of animal influences the bioaccumulation process, with that in mind the thesis conducted
a study of OCPs on biota samples collected from the supermarkets and fishermen on the eastern
province of Kingdom Saudi Arabia. A novel on site sample preparation approach for the OCPs
using micro solid phase microextraction with a battery operated continuous flow device has been
developed, this handheld battery operated flow pump was used to provide agitation of the sample
solution at the sampling site to facilitate extraction. The proposed system was developed to meet
the demand for an effective, efficient, and affordable on site large volume sampling tool for
monitoring of pollutants in the sea water.
