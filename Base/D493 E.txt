The major objective of this thesis is to develop an Intelligent Alarm Processor
(IAP) for processing excessive alarms at the Power Control Center (PCC) especially
during a major power disturbance. The received alarms will be analyzed by the IAP
and the outcome will be presented to the dispatcher in a shorter, more concise and
meaningful manner.
The processing of multiple alarms into fewer concise statements is best
achieved by applying artificial intelligence techniques into the received alarms. In this
thesis, a rule based Expert System consisting of 61 rules is developed. It utilizes
CLIPS as a tool with a forward chaining reasoning. This system emulates an
experienced dispatcher at the PCC in analyzing the power system alarms to reach a definite conclusion. The desired conclusion describes what has happened on the
network. Such a conclusion is needed to lead to the course of actions required to
return the power system to the normal state as soon as possible.
The developed IAP manipulates the received alarms on the basis defined by
the derived empirical rules to produce the descriptive messages. Furthermore, it
controls the suppression and display of information to the dispatcher on the basis of
what he needs and does not need to see. In deriving the required conclusion, the IAP
relies heavily on the connectivity data of the network to relate the various equipment
to each other
