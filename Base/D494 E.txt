An office building is designed and built to h o st a group of people
perform ing distinct office work. The perform ance of th e u s e rs of su ch
a building is substantially influenced by its environm ental quality.
E nvironm ental Quality Factors (EQF) are lighting, acoustic, therm al
a n d indoor air quality. The evaluation of environm ental q uality of
su c h a building is a n indication of how well this building achieves the
environm ental comfort for its users.
This study addressed th e evaluation of environm ental quality of
office buildings as an integrated approach (lighting, acoustic, therm al
a n d indoor a ir quality). In th is research, the perform ance criteria
(variables) of EQF an d th e sc ale s u se d for e v a lu a tin g th e se
perform ance criteria (attributes) w ere ex tracted from tw o m ain
sources: The first by carrying o u t a n extensive lite ra tu re review
th ro u g h published papers, reports, books, etc. related to EQF. The
second by conducting the interviews w ith 21 academ icians an d 29
p ractitio n ers who are considered experts in th ese a re a s in th e
E astern Province of the Kingdom of S audi Arabia.
Sixty five perform ance criteria (variables) a n d th e ir a ttrib u te s
w ere extracted to investigate an d com prehend th e EQF a n d u se d to
build the knowledge base of environm ental quality evaluation of office
buildings. Also, the evaluation m ethods th a t the dom ain experts are
using for assessing the environm ent of office buildings were analyzed.
A com puterized unified program u sin g E x p ert S y stem for
