A field prototype multiphase m eter has been designed, constructed,
installed at a rem ote onshore oil field site and successfully trial tested. The
multiphase m etering set up is based on the Coriolis principle to measure
the oil, water, and gas. The intent of testing die set up was to confirm the
unit's ability, in a remote unmanned location, to sufficiently separate the
gas and liquid phases in a small conditioner pipe, m easure the rate of each
phase and determ ine the water cut.
Thirty direct comparison tests w ith the conventional test trap were
conducted at two pressure ranges of 250 300 psig and 550 600 psig to test
the effect of different gas void fractions which ranged up to 88 . The unit
was successfully evaluated at liquid rates up to 7.2 MBD. Variance in
liquid rates w ith the conventional test trap were less than 10 . The
designed set up gave good gas reading for gas rates above 1.5 MMSCFD,
at lower gas rates the set up measured slightly low.
