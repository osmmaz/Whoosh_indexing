Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require very efficient algorithms for data
processing, compression and routing due to the limited resources of sensor nodes. As
WSNs are commonly deployed for monitoring the remote and hazardous environments, it
is not feasible to recharge or replace the battery of sensor nodes. Therefore, sensor nodes
should use their energy very efficiently even when a power harvesting technique is used
with the battery of limited capacity.
