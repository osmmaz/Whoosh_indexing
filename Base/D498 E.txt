Owing to their low production cost, good physical properties and lightweight, plastic
objects have slowly substituted glass, paper and metals in several fields of application.
The current huge global production of plastics (200 million tons/year) has generated
enormous environmental concerns, mainly related to the waste generation by plastic
packaging, which are responsible for 35—40  share of annual plastics consumption. If
plastic bags are dumped in the city and go into drainage and sewage lines, causing
blockages, if disposed of by landfill, the plastics worsen the shortage of landfill sites. If
the plastics are incinerated, they can emit green house gases as well as poisonous gases
such as dioxins. So making plastic bags degradable is one way to try to ease the task of
waste reduction.
We study the influence of adding photodegradable additives to film grade polyethylene
under natural weathering conditions in Saudi Arabia. We investigated the degradation
products and determine the time required to convert the material into gases or low
molecular weight hydrocarbons. Plastic films were prepared by first premixing the film
grade polyethylene pellets with different amounts of additives. The films were exposed in
outdoor environments located in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Samples of the films were
drawn at regular intervals and evaluated for degradation.
