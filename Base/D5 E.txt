Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after
Alzheimer's disease. It is caused by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra (SN) region of the brain. The most prominent symptoms of PD are resting tremors, rigidity,
bradykinesia, and postural instability. A major pathological hallmark of the disease is the
accumulation of Lewy Bodies (LBs) and Lewy Neurites (LNs), protein rich inclusions that
deposit in the neurons. These inclusions are mainly composed of alpha synuclein , a small
protein with a propensity to aggregate. Evidence from genetic, biochemical and pathological
studies suggest that the aggregation of   syn plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PD and
related disorders, such as dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy
(MSA), collectively termed synucleinopathies. Till date, the diagnosis of PD primarily depends
on the clinical criteria, however, this approach has some limitations since the neurodegeneration
starts several years before. This necessitates the development of reliable biomarkers that can
allow early diagnosis of PD, preferably at the preclinical stage. Accumulative evidence suggests
that majority of   syn from LBs in the brains of PD patients is found to be phosphorylated at
Serine 129, thus highlighting the importance of phosphorylated   syn at S129 (pS129   syn) as a
potential biomarker for PD. For this reason, we developed mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb)
specific for pS129   syn and another mAb specific for non phosphorylated form of   syn at
S129 (nonpS129   syn). To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the generation of
an antibody specific for nonpS129 a syn. In this study, we describe the production and thorough
characterization of these two antibodies, highlighting that our antibodies represent useful tools
for research, good candidates for biomarkers development, and even immunotherapy for PD and
related disorders.
