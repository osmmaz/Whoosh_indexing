This thesis is concerned with using a priori information on the communication
problem to enhance the performance of adaptive algorithms. We demonstrate
this for two scenarios.
In the first part of the thesis, we consider the problem of channel estimation
for multiuser OFDM transmission over block time varying channels. We show
that frequency domain based channel estimation can be more practical and less
computationally complex than the time domain based estimation. We show how
a priori information (time and frequency correlation) allows us to design Kalman
filters and obtain a very good performance in environments with high Doppler.
In the second part we use our a priori knowledge about the output noise distribution
to design adaptive filters with optimum error nonlinearities. Specifically, we use the energy relation that is usually used for mean square analysis to derive
the mean square error for general error nonlinearities and subsequently use
that to design optimum error nonlinearities given our knowledge about the noise
distribution. We use a similar technique to design adaptive filters with optimum
error nonlinearities and data normalization that is usually used when the input
data is correlated.
