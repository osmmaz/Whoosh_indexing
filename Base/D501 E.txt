Prepositional satisfiability (SAT) is one of the classical problem in computer science
discipline. The importance of SAT comes from the fact that it was the first problem
proven to be NP Complete which means that a large class of real world problems can be
expressed in terms of a SAT instance. Many algorithms were proposed to solve this
problem efficiently over the last decades and they can be categorized into two types:
complete and incomplete algorithms. Complete algorithms can state whether the instance
is satisfied (the answer is yes) giving the truth assignment or unsatisfied (the answer is
no) indicating that it is impossible to find one. The incomplete algorithms can only give
an answer of yes to satisfiable instances but cannot give an answer of no to unsatisfiable
ones since their nature is to continuously search for a satisfying assignment until one is
found. The thesis reviews the research work done in these two categories and give
description to the major results achieved. It also proposes a new algorithm that falls in the
first category and it differs from the ones in the literature in severals aspects. It does not
do any backtracking during the searching process that usually consumes significant time
as it is the case with other algorithms. The searching process is simple, easy to
implement, and each step is determined instantly unlike other algorithms where decisions
are made based on some heuristics or random decisions.
