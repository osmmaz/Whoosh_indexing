In this thesis, a new generic CMOS circuit for realizing different nonlinear functions
from the same topology is presented. This circuit can be very useful in Neural
Networks applications as it implements the main nonlinearities required by many
types o f Neural Networks. With transistors operating in strong inversion the circuit
can be digitally configured to realize any o f the following four functions: Gaussian
(Radial Basis), Sigmoid and two piecewise linear functions   Triangular and Satlin.
The circuit can approximate these functions with RRMS error less than 1 . It is
shown that the center, width, peak amplitude and slope o f the dc transfer curve can be
independently controlled. Simulation results using 0.18 CMOS process model
parameters o f TSMC technology are included
