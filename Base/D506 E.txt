A new technology for mercury removal from liquid hydrocarbon is of prime
importance. Mercury has been considered as a priority hazardous material, due
to its adverse effects on human health, industries and the environment.
Industrially the mercury metal corrosion effect on gas processing plant systems,
particularly the aluminum heat exchangers, is well known and has caused failures
over the past several decades. The other issue with mercury is that even at low
ppb level, this substance is poisonous to precious catalysts used in petrochemical
industrial plants to convert gas and other petroleum based products to chemicals.
Several technologies have been implemented to reduce mercury content below 1
ppb in hydrocarbon streams such as gas and light naphtha. However, no
technology is available yet to remove mercury from the whole gas condensate or
from the crude oil. The removal of mercury from liquid hydrocarbon is a very
challenging task as this depends on stream composition, the forms of mercury
contents and the water content. This work introduces a new novel sorbents where
carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, activated carbon, fly ash and their modified forms
with certain metals for the removal of mercury from whole gas condensate. Up to
92  of mercury removal was achieved using these new sorbents. These
sorbents are potentially scalable to remove mercury from liquid hydrocarbons
under the actual field conditions.
