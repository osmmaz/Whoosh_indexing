Statistical machine translation (SMT) treats the translation of natural language as a
machine learning problem. By examining many samples of human produced translations,
SMT algorithms automatically learn how to translate. In this thesis, we discuss the
automatic machine translation from English to Arabic using a statistical phrase based
approach employing a parallel Arabic English corpus that was developed manually by
more than one translator. Statistical machine translation (SMT) consists of two phases:
The training phase and the decoding phase. In the training phase, the statistical language
model and the translation model are built. In the decoding phase, the best possible
translation is chosen depending on a comprehensive search process. We built a sizable
parallel corpus spanning various categories of topics from the Meedan website, and later
compared the results of Meedan with that of the other two corpora: LDC and UN. The
performance was compared based on the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU). Our
experimentation shows that, overall, the Meedan corpus outperformed the other two
corpora in most categories. We, also, compared the performance of the Moses decoder
and the Pharaoh decoder. We conclude that although the response time for the pharaoh
xii
decoder is better than that of the Moses decoder, the quality of the translation of the
Moses decoder exceeds that of the Pharaoh decoder.
