Transient stability is an important part of power system design and
operation. This thesis deals with the application of Multiterminal Direct
Current(MTDC) systems for transient stability enhancement because of its fast
response at exchanging electrical power with AC system.
A mathematical model for the MTDC system components has been
developed in the thesis. All the differential equations of MTDC system and
controllers are modeled in an algebraic form and are solved by the trapezoidal
rule.
A linear Programming optimization model has been developed as a mean
to seek for an optimum control strategy. The method uses the Golden Search
approach to improve the solution as another new control scheme. Two types of
control schemes with generator rotor slip and other signals as an input to the
controllers have been studied .
The developed controlling schemes have been applied using two
multimachine power systems. A comparative study between the control methods
has been carried out. The transient stability performance with applying Linear
Programming and Golden Search is found to be superior compared to the other
methods.
