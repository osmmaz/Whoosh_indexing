Flow injection analysis is based on the injection of a liquid sample into a moving, non
segmented, continuous barrier stream of a suitable liquid. The injected sample forms a
zone transported toward a detector that continuously records a physical parameter such as
absorbance, electrode potential. The system consists of a pump to propel carrier stream
through a tube of certain length and diameter, an injection port from where the welldefined
volume of a sample is injected into a carrier stream. A reactor in which the sample
zone disperses and reacts with carrier stream a detector that senses forming species and a
recorder.
The detector is the heart of the system that gives the analytical signals related to the
concentration. Among them the optical detectors especially spectrophotometric ones are
the most commonly used. However for the spectrophotometric detectors, the detection is
limited to the formation of colored complexes. Although electrochemical detectors are
also widely used it is first time that differential electrolytic potentiometric detector was
introduced in flow injection analysis.
The purpose of this work is to check the applicability of the polarized solid electrodes as
detectors in the flow injection analysis and to investigate the parameters that are involved
such as flow rate, current etc, in several types of reaction systems
