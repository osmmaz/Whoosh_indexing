Tungsten oxide (WO3) was used as visible light active photocatalyst for the removal of
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from contaminated groundwater. Visible light driven
WO3 nanostructured photocatalyst was synthesized using a hydrothermal method. For
comparison of photocatalytic activity, commercial micron sized tungsten oxide was also
used. The surface of photocatalysts was further modified with noble metals such as
platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru) and resulting activity of samples were compared. The
experimental results indicated that the removal of MTBE could be achieved very fast in
presence of Pt loaded nanostructured WO3 under visible light radiation (96 99  removal
within 150 180 minutes). The Pt/WO3 nano composite showed much better
photocatalytic removal of MTBE than Ru/WO3 and pure nanostructured and micronsized
WO3. An attempt was also made to study the formation of by products during
photocatalytic degradation of MTBE using GC MS. The study revealed that the
degradation of MTBE proceeds essentially via formation of formic acid and 1, 1 
dimethylethyl ester before its complete degradation.
