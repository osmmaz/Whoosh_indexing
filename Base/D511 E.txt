In this study, a general transient model is developed for the biofiltration o f mixed volatile
organic compounds. The model incorporates general mixing phenomena, oxygen limitation effects,
adsorption phenomena and actual biodegradation reaction kinetics. Solutions are presented with
and without the assumption o f pseudo steady state for the biofilm leading to approximate and
general models, respectively. The models are solved and validated for the cases o f single VOCs
and binary VOC mixtures. Dynamic analysis o f die model is performed and compared with
experimental data from the literature. Significant improvement in the model prediction is observed
in comparison to earlier simplified models. The general model is superior to the approximate
model as it does not require any correlations and its predictions seem to be better than the
approxim ate model. However, the general model is mathematically very complex and difficult to
solve, contrary to the approximate model. A thorough sensitivity analysis shows that mixing in the
gas phase is an important phenomenon which should not be neglected and that some parameters
need to be accurately estimated. Theoretical analysis shows that the assumption o f excess oxygen
availability is not a good one, specially at high inlet VOC concentration levels. The performance
o f the biofilter was analyzed when subjected to perturbations o f various operational parameters.
Transient behavior during shut down and restart up are also well predicted by the model and the
transient period does not seem to be very long. Model predictions show that the biofilter is able to
withstand extreme practical conditions such as random variations in the inlet concentration and gas
flow rate.
