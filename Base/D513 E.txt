Liquid desiccants are widely used fo r dehumidification o f air. In order to analyze
the performance of the system using desiccant technology, the thermophysical
properties of desiccants are essential. In particular, the vapor pressure o f the liquid
desiccant is one of the important properties in dehumidification. Classical thermodynamic
approach is used to predict the vapor pressure of lithium chloride at different
concentrations. Simple mixing rules are then used to predict the vapor pressure,
density and viscosity of the desiccant mixture namely calcium chloride and lithium
chloride.
Drying of petroleum transmission pipelines involves passing of dehumidified air
with a certain initial water vapor concentration until the air attains saturation level.
For this drying problem, the governing equations are derived and solved analytically
as well as numerically with appropriate boundary conditions for the variation of dry
air concentration and the drying time.
Liquid desiccant used for dehumidification has to be reconcentrated for reuse. Instead
of using thermal energy, a method is proposed in this thesis to use mechanical
energy for regeneration. Osmotic pressure required to regenerate the weak desiccant
for a given concentration is predicted. Correlations for predicting the pressure required
for regenerating the weak desiccant are also developed for different operating
parameters.
