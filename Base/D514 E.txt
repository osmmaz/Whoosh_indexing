Many researches have been conducted regarding the degradation of p Cresol using
electrochemical oxidation process, and that method has recently achieved considerable success.
This is mainly due to its higher removal efficiency and lower cost compared to other treatment
methods. However, the process has experienced some difficulties, mainly due performance of
the electrode material used in the process. The main objective of this study is to investigate the
degradation of p Cresol in industrial wastewater by electrochemical process, using 4 types of
electrodes (stainless steel, aluminum. Graphite and diamond), synthetic industrial wastewater
was used on this study with deionized water as a base solvent. In final stage raw water used as
base solvent of the synthetic wastewater to study the effect of the electrodes material on the
process (one experiment for each electrode). And finally the polarization effect of the
electrodes on the process was studied. A lab scale experimental reactor was used to carry out
the electrochemical oxidation of p Cresol. The results showed that 20 mA/sq cm was found to
be the optimum current realized in this Study, There were considerable difference among the
electrodes in their effectiveness And performance, It was found that the highest removal of p 
Cresol was achieved by Diamond, graphite, followed by stainless steel while aluminum
electrode doesn’t show Any removal. The optimum polarity time is 30 seconds, in addition
polarization increases the removal percentage, and reduces time of treatment. It was found that
the commercial aluminum electrodes is not suitable to remove p Cresol. The findings of this
study are expected to contribute in solving the p Cresol degradation problem and enhancing the
environmental efforts to remove p Cresol from the Industrial wastewater.
