An entropy constrained reflected residual vector quantization (EC RRVQ) design
algorithm is introduced as an alternative to entropy constrained residual vector quantization
(EC RVQ) and used to design codebooks for image coding. EC RRVQ is able
to realize a more ordered or less random codebook, that offers two advantages. The
first is that an ordered codebook have lowe outptrt entropy while the second has to do
with simplifying the search procedure used to find the best codeword. The idea discussed
in this work is to introduce EC RRVQ as a new baseline quantization scheme
with single path search and improved rate distortion performance, which if joined
with other transform, and subband coding methods will result in a competitive design.
Because of single path search, the EC RRVQ has the potential to be a serious
contender in the list of large block vector quantization implementation algorithms.
Experimental results indicate that good image reproduction quality can be accomplished
at relatively low bit rates. The performance of 16 x 16 EC RRVQ at 0.2 bpp
is 29 dB as compared to 28.39 dB for EC RVQ with same dimensions and bit rate.
