The Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (E TSP) is one of the important NPcomplete
problems that has many applications in real life. In this thesis, we propose an
Enhanced Convex Elastic Net technique that combines an adaptive type neural network
model and an iterative algorithm for solving E TSP. The main advantage of this
technique is that it can be implemented in parallel architecture which is potentially faster
than sequential architecture. The simulation results performed have shown that the
proposed technique yields a sub optimal solution that compares favorably with several
known techniques such as Guilty Net, Hopfield and Tank Model, Elastic Net, and
Simulated Annealing.
