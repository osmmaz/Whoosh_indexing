OFDM modulation combines the advantages of high achievable rates and relatively
easy implementation. In this Thesis, we focus on the receiver design for OFDM transmission
over block fading channels. Blind and semiblind techniques are developed for
channel estimation and data recovery. The techniques use as many a priori information
about the communication problem as possible to reduce the training overhead
and/or improve the channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate. The thesis develops
two blind techniques, a data centered technique (i.e. the input data is the main
unknown) and the other is channel centered (i.e. channel is the main unknown). In
the data centered blind technique, we show how an OFDM symbol can be blindly
detected using output symbol and associated cyclic prefix. The approach is based
on the transformation of the OFDM channel into two parallel subchannels due to
the presence of cyclic prefix at the input. In the channel centered blind approach, the cyclic prefix and the Gaussian assumption on the transmitted data in an OFDM
system are used for channel estimation and subsequent data detection. Finally, the
thesis considers a more realistic problem in which we design a semiblind receiver for
space time coded OFDM transmission over MIMO frequency selective, time variant,
and spatially correlated channels.
