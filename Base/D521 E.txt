Experimental studies such as electrochemical polarization measurements, weight loss,
open circuit potential and elevated temperature closed loop techniques were used to
investigate the effect of heat treatment on the corrosion resistance of Aluminum
metal matrix composite Al6013 20SiC(P) in 3.5 wt.  NaCl solution and Arabian
Gulf water, at temperatures ranging from 30°C to 130°C under controlled variable
velocities.
It was shown that alloy Al60l3 20SiC(P) in T4 temper (age hardened) showed
maximum resistance to corrosion. Studies on the variation of open circuit potential
of alloy Al6013 20SiC(P) in T4 ternper with time, showed thut the potential o f the
alloy shifted to more noble values compared to alloy in O ternper and F form. A
strong tendency for an oxide film formation on alloy in T4 temper was therefore
suggested. Pitting was the most, predominant form of localized corrosion attack,
observed on the alloy. It occurred at. metal rnatrix/SiC interface, and there was no
evidence of attack on SiC particles. The pitting resistance of the alloy in general
decreased on increasing the temperature from 30°C to 130°C. The alloy in T4 temper
also showed a maximum resistance to pitting at elevated temperatures, compared to
O temper and F form.
