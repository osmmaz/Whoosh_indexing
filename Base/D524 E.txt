Line search is a major component in the structure of the conjugate gradient
method to solve unconstraind optimization problems. But its exact implementation
to nonquadratic functions is unlikely in most of the cases. This
thesis deals with a self contained study of inexact line search and its effect
on the convergence of certain modifications and extensions of the conjugate
gradient method. We describe in detail various algorithms due to these extensions
and apply them to some of the standard test functions.
