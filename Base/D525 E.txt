Waste materials recycling has been the logical and widely accepted means of conserving
the diminishing global natural resources, this is as a result of increased scarcity of raw
industrial materials, coupled with environmental hazard of most of the waste. For the
same reason there is an increasing interest in studies focusing on finding alternative
material and economical material sources. In this work, the effect of different waste
material fillers (namely: Lime dust, Heavy oil fly ash and cement kiln dust), sulfur, oil
sludge on the physical properties and performance of roofing and waterproofing asphalt
has been examined. Physical and performance testing (Bond strength test, Softening point
test, Ductility test, Penetration test, Viscosity and Flash point test) were conducted on the
modified asphalt mastic, and finally the results were analyzed statistically and properties
modeled in terms of additives composition. Some selected blends were compared to
conventional roofing asphalt mastic blend. Results show promising potential alternative
and cost effective material composite having least amount of asphalt component.
