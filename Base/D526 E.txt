Schools in Saudi Arabia are of three levels: elementary, intermediary and secondary
schools. It is thought that most of these schools built several years ago are based on the
assumption that majority of its students will be walking to and from the schools since
most of these schools were not provided with drop off/pick up areas. This research aimed
to study the characteristics of trips attracted to local public boys’ schools and suggest
possible remedies to mitigate their adverse effect on the road network. It was found that
the best variables which can be used to predict the number of attracted and parked
vehicles are the number of students and number of employees. From the questionnaire
analysis, it is obvious that 60  of overall students are suffering from congestion around
schools but still 50  of them are coming to schools by passenger cars. Also, more than
60  of the students are ready to use the public transportation. With 33  of overall
students ready to use the public transportation if it is free, 27  can pay an average of 50
SR.
