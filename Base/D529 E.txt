Tribological behavior of Al 6061 alloy reinforced with 20  submicron (0.7 nm) AI2O3
particles was examined under dry and lubricated conditions at temperatures ranging from
25°C to 300°C. Wear tests were performed against AISI 4041 steel counterface material
at selected loads using a pin on disk type apparatus using graphite and molybdenum
disulfide burnished powders as solid lubricants. Under dry conditions, the wear resistance
of the composite was characterized by two regimes namely mild and severe wear at all
temperatures. However, the critical load for severe wear was found to decrease with
increase in temperature, indicating decrease in wear resistance with increase in
temperature. The worn surfaces were characterized by abrasion, delamination and
adhesion in mild, transition and severe wear regions respectively at room temperature.
However, at elevated temperatures, matrix softening of the composite was found to be
dominant mechanism of wear in addition to particulate fracture. Lubrication using
graphite was found to be effective only at room temperature and upto 3 ON normal load.
At high temperatures, severe wear rates and high coefficients of friction resulted under
graphite lubrication because of absence of vapor and moisture at high temperature
required for superlubricity of graphite. When molybdenum disulfide was employed as
solid lubricant, the wear rates and coefficients of friction were drastically reduced when
compared with dry conditions at respective loads and temperatures. The composite worn
surfaces under M0S2 lubrication were characterized by smooth surface covered with
M0S2 layers evident by EDS analysis.
