A 2 D radial compositional simulator was used to investigate the effect of
liquid drop out on the productivity of a rich gas condensate reservoir. A seven layer
reservoir model was constructed based on well logs and core analysis data. A two
phase relative permeability model was used to generate the relative permeability
curves for the oil and gas phases assuming the initial water saturation is immobile.
The pore size distribution index required in the relative permeability model was
calculated by finding the slope of the log log plot of the J function versus
normalized water saturation obtained from the air displacing brine experiment.
Major objective of this study includes identification of parameter controlling the
productivity of the gas condensate well, evaluation of the effect of condensate dropout
near the wellbore on well productivity, determination of optimum production
rate and investigation of the extent of condensate banks in different layers. It was
concluded that gas condensate well productivity is reduced as the critical condensate
saturation increases. Gas production rate more than 40MMSCF/D offers no
significant improvement on cumulative gas and condensate produced, Ninety one
percent (91 ) reduction in gas flow productivity was observed for all production
rates investigated. The percent liquid condensed near the wellbore in all layers
ranged between 37 to 44 percent and there are noticeable changes in pressure
distribution near the wellbore in all layers though it remains the same at a distance
more than 100 ft away from the wellbore.
