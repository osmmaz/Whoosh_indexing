The aim of this work is to give more insight about the performance of Adaptive
Filters. Studying this performance will help researchers to understand the in
u 
ences that will a ect this. This work can be divided into two parts as follows :
In the  rst part, we used the majorization theory as a mathematical tool to study
the e ect of the input correlation scenarios on the performance of adaptive  lters.
With this, we provide a mechanism to assess their performance. Also, with ma 
jorization theory, vector comparison is carried out and their order is preserved
through Schur's functions. Each correlation scenario can be totally described by
the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix Ru. Thus, a comparison between these
scenarios can be done and a comparison between the responses of adaptive  lters
to these scenarios can also be done. In the second part, a new approach for study 
ing the steady state performance of the Recursive Least Square (RLS) adaptive
xii
 lter for a circularly correlated Gaussian input. The mean square analysis of the
RLS  lter in the steady state relies on the moment of the random variable kuik2
Pi ,
where ui is input to the RLS  lter and Pi is the estimate of the inverse of input
covariance matrix. Earlier approaches evaluate this moment by assuming that ui
and Pi are independent which could result in negative value of the steady state
Excess Mean Square Error (EMSE). In this work, we avoid this assumption and
derive a closed from expression for this moment. This derivation is based on
 nding the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable of the
form 1

+jjujj2
D
, where u is correlated circular Gaussian input and D is a diagonal
matrix. As a result, we obtain more accurate estimate of the EMSE of the RLS
algorithm.
