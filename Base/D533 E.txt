Particulate reinforced metal matrix composites (MMC) have been used in several
applications where high mechanical performance and other related properties are
paramount requirements. High specific modulus, low thermal expansion coefficient, good
wear resistance, low density and low cost are the major attractive characteristics of this
class of materials in aerospace, automobile and construction industries. Localized
corrosion, in these alloys, is usually insidious and may lead to catastrophic service
failures. This can only be minimized by incorporating corrosion control at the design
stage and by modifying the processing routes.
The corrosion behavior of four different types of aluminum alloy was studied.
Two of these alloys (F3K.20S and F3S.20S) are reinforced with 20  by vol. SiC while
the remaining two samples (F3S.OOS, and F3K.00S) are not reinforced. Weight loss,
potentiodynamic and cyclic polarization techniques were used to study their corrosion
behavior in 3.5 wt NaCl solution. Micro analytical studies such as optical micrography,
scanning electron micrography (SEM), X ray diffraction, X ray fluorescence (XRF) were
utilized to analyze the role o f intermetallic phases in both corroded and non corroded
samples o f these mentioned alloys.
The results showed that un re inforced alloys have higher corrosion resistance as
compared to their reinforced counterparts. Pits observed in all the alloys show different
shapes and structures. Some intermetallic phases in the reinforced alloys were suspected
to have contributed to the formation of localized corrosion.
