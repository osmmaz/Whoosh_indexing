Analysis of well test data from multilayered reservoirs can be quite complicated, especially
when one considers the possibility of cross flow between the layers. Moreover, when one or
more of the layers are naturally fractured, another degree of complexity is added. The
permeability of the different layers, as well as the properties of the natural fractures can result
in pressure and pressure derivative behavior that is quite different from the behavior of a single
layer reservoir. Natural fracture parameters such as the storativity ratio, and the
interporosity flow parameter, may have a significant effect on the pressure buildup
behavior, especially when both layers are fractured.
In this study, a numerical approach is used to investigate the effect of permeability variation, as
well as the storativity ratio and the interporosity flow parameter, on the pressure transient
behavior of two layered reservoirs, where one layer is homogeneous, while the other layer is
naturally fractured. Alternatively, both layers could be naturally fractured with different
fracture density.
Results from this study show that the variation of the fractured layer parameters,  and ,
revealed different pressure behavior responses, and in some cases, the response is seen only
when the well is shut in for a very long period. Short shut in tests of the well may lead to the
wrong estimates of the parameters for each layer, which may affect the understanding of the
whole system.
