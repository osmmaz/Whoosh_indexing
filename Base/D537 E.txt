Experimental investigation is carried out to study the heat transfer characteristics in
a rectangular duct cooled by an array o f impinging jets. Air ejected from an array o f orifice
jets is aimed at the heated target surface and exits from the radial outlets. The effect o f
outflow orientation, feeding channel aspect ratios 5 <H/ d <9 and je t to target plate
distance 4 < S / d <8 is investigated with a single array o f equally spaced orifice jets. The
effect o f je t Reynolds number is also studied with the range fo r orifice plate 1 and 2 being
5000 < Re j <10000 and fo r orifice plates 2, 3 and 4 being 9300 < Re} <18800. The effect o f
orifice jet diameter on the heat transfer distribution is also studied with d = 0.5 and \cm.
Results indicate that the outflow orientation causing crossflow effect significantly affects
the Nusselt number distributions on the target surface. Local Nusselt number increases with
an increase in je t Reynolds number over the entire impingement surface. Nusselt number is
also significantly affected by the feeding channel aspect ratio H i d the jet to plate spacing
S / d . The feeding channel aspect ratio H i d which gives the maximum heat transfer is
obtained fo r all the orifice plates. Similarly the jet to plate distance S / d which gives
maximum heat transfer compared to the other jet to plate distances is also found fo r all the
orifice plates studied individually. The highest Nusselt numbers are obtained fo r the outflow
orientation where the flow exits in both the directions. Correlations were developed for
averaged Nusselt number as a function ofjet Reynolds number fo r all the orifice plates.
