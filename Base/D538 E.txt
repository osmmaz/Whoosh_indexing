The effect of pH and various alcohol water mixtures on the electronic
spectra and excited state dynamics of thymine, one of the DNA constituents, have
been investigated. A mode locked Nd:YAG laser in combination with a cavitydumped
synchronously pumped dye laser is used as a source o f excitation.
Fluorescence decay and time resolved spectra were recorded with picosecond
photon counting spectrometer. Steady state fluorescence spectra as well as
ultraviolet absorption spectra were also recorded.
Fluorescence spectra of thymine in aqueous solutions where thymine exists
in the neutral form have been found to vary in shape as the excitation wavelength is
increased. This change in shape is explained by the presence of another tautomer
beside the predominant diketo tautomer o f thymine. This minor tautomer is
believed to be 5 methyl 2 hydoxy 4(3H) pyrimidinone or the keto enol tautomer.
Lifetime analysis o f fluorescence decays support this explanation where a
biexponential decay with lifetimes of around 0.7 and 4 ns is observed for the
neutral form of thymine. Time resolved spectra are in accordance with this
explanation.
Fluorescence lifetimes of thymine do not vary in methanol water and
ethanol water mixtures. While the lifetime of the keto enol tautomer is found to
vary with viscosities of the 1 propanol water mixtures. This is explained by
solvent solvent and solute solvent interaction. According to the steady state and
time resolved fluorescence spectra in the various alcohol water mixtures, thymine
does not undergo a pKa shift in the excited state.
