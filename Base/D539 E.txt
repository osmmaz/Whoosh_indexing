Vibration control is a large area of interest either in all sections of industry or
in research. One way to control the vibration of dynamic systems is by using
piezoelectric materials (PZT's). PZT's have been used to reduce vibration in both
active and passive control systems and that is due to their special characteristics. In
this work, the effect of the PZT actuator location on controlling the vibrations is
studied. Two structures are used in the study, a 2 D beam and a 3 D plate with two
different control techniques, an LQR controller and an LQG controller. The modeling
is done using the well known finite element method. Results were found by
simulating the cases in MATLAB. Validation of the results is done in ANSYS.
