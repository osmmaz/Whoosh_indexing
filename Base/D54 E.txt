Adaptive equalizers are used in most modem communication systems to compensate
for channel distortion in order to achieve reliable data transmission. Quite a steady
research in this field has been made in the literature for over the last four decades
and still remain a subject of ongoing investigation. This thesis present adaptive
equalization scheme using a new power of two quantizer algorithm. The new algorithm,
which is non mean square based, provides a simplification to least mean
fourth (LMF) algorithm and also addresses the non optimal performance problem of
power of two quantizer based least mean square (LMS) algorithm when used in non 
Gaussian environment. From the moment based analysis of the LMF algorithm,
we outline the basic idea behind the development of this new algorithm as well as
the necessary assumptions and identifiable conditions required for its convergence
behaviour. Derivations of pertinent parameters and the convergence analysis of the
new algorithm are presented and the result of simulation carried out verifies the theoretical
predictions.
