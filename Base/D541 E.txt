This thesis focuses on production, inventory, warranty and quality control problem
from both producer’s and consumer’s point of view. The purpose of this thesis is
twofold. First, models for the producers which integrate lot sizing, warranty and
quality improvement through preventive maintenance are developed. Second, integrated
inventory and quality assurance models for the consumer are developed.
In the first part, joint lot sizing and warranty models with and without preventive
maintenance are developed for an imperfect production process. The process starts
in in control state then shifts at a random point in time to out of control state and
starts producing more fraction of nonconforming items. The time to shift follows
a general distribution. Effects of preventive maintenance on quality and warranty
costs are investigated. In the second part, consumer’s inventory and quality assurance
decisions through inspection are integrated in a single model. Models for both
deterministic and stochastic demand are considered. It is assumed that the lot fraction
nonconforming is a random variable following a beta distribution. Constraints
on consumer and producer’s risks are included to generate fair plans for both parties.
Numerical examples are presented and sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate
different aspects and features of the proposed models. It is shown through
numerical examples that the joint policies always result in a better solution then
separate once.
