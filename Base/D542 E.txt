Recently the polyacrylamide chromium(III) gel system has been used as a
flow control agent to improve the water oil ratio(WOR) in water flooding operations
and wells plagued by water conning. Gel divert the movements of water from high
permeability thin zones and fractures to the bypassed regions leading to improved
sweep effeciency.
As temperature increases gelation time becomes shorter limiting the
application of the gel at high temperature. In this study an evaluation of the
effectiveness of sodium lactate in delaying the gelation time at different temperatures
was investigated. The gel viscosity at different temperatures, times and shear rates
was measured. The plugging effeciency of the gel was studied by injecting the gel
solution through sandstone and limestone cores.
Results obtained showed that sodium lactate was effective in prolonging the
gelation time from hours to days depending on its concentration. The gel was found
to be stable during the period of study. The gel viscosity increased with time and
increased if the temperature was increased. The gel viscosity decreased if shear rate
was increased. The permeability of the cores was reduced to less than 1.0   of its
original value. The results obtained could be used as a guide in the design of water
shutoff treatments for field application.
