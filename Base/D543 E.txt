This study was carried out to analyze more than eighty outcrop samples from the
carbonate Dam Formation in Al Lidam area in the Eastern Province   Saudi Arabia for
texture, mineralogy, and to investigate the influence of confining pressure on
compressional and shear wave velocities at room temperature. The methods used in this
study included field investigations, facies analysis, petrographic analysis, petrophysical
analysis, and acoustic data analysis.
The laboratory investigations revealed that Dam Formation in Al Lidam area has four
facies types including, mudstone, packstone, wackestone and grainstone. The measured
porosity values range between 52  and 55  with an average value 38  and
permeability values from 0.39 mD to 18 D, with an average of 3 D.
The results show that P wave and S waves velocities increase with the increase in confining
pressure for dry samples. The P wave velocity increased and the S wave velocity decreased
with confining pressure under saturated condition. This increase is non linear with confining
pressure. A regression equation of the form gives a good fit to the
measured velocity when compared with equations suggested by other studies.
