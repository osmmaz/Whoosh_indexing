Fifty percent of accidents occur at intersections. Therefore
understanding the problems at intersections may lead to better
improvement strategies.

The main goal of this study was to investigate the effect of
sight distance on the safety of unsignalized intersections using
traffic conflicts. Traffic conflicts were employed because reliable
accident information is not available at this time.

Conflict studies have been carried out at twenty one inter 
sections in the Eastern Province. Using this data the effect of
sight distance have been analyzed.

The analysis was done using Multiple Regression Analysis,
Analysis of Variance and Covariance, and Multiple Classification
Analysis. Uncontrolled and stop controlled approaches have been
analyzed separately.

Finally conclusions of the study and recommendations for
the improvement of safety at unsignalized intersections were
reported.
