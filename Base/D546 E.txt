Ion transport membrane (ITM) based reactor is one of the developing technologies for
carbon dioxide capture and sequestration which integrates air separation and fuel
conversion. These ITM reactors use mixed conducting oxygen permeable ceramic
membranes which can simultaneously transport both oxygen ions and electrons without
the requirement of an external circuit. However, the oxygen permeability of these
membranes is relatively low which still hinders their use in industrial applications. One of
the potential materials for oxygen permeability is the La2NiO4 (LNO), which is known
for its high temperature stability.
In this study, LNO powders were synthesized by sol gel method from nitrate solutions.
These powders were compacted to obtain LNO membranes and characterized using Xray
diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A gas permeation
system was built for the oxygen flux measurement. This system was connected to a gas
chromatograph for quantitative analysis. Thick membranes (1mm) were used for
permeability measurements at temperature of 700°C.
The oxygen permeability of the LNO membrane was measured with different ratios of
oxygen and nitrogen in the feed gas. The permeability increased with the increase in
xiii
oxygen concentration on the feed side. The oxygen permeability was also tested with
respect to temperature and the flux was found to increase with increasing temperature. A
