The concepts cyclic purity and total purity for modules are defined by Simmons over
commutative domains. In this work equational approaches are used to generalise these
concepts and related results to modules over arbitrary rings. It is shown here that single
splitness and single compactness as defined by Azumaya, coincide with these generalised
versions o f cyclic purity and total purity. Among other results, rings all o f whose modules
are totally pure are characterized, and coflatness is used to characterize rings over which
every totally pure module is injective.
