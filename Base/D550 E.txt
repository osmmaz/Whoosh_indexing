During service, engineering structures and components made from
Carbon Fiber reinforced Plastics (CFRPs) are often subjected to cyclic
loading as well as varying environmental temperatures. Fatigue failure o f
CFRPs is complicated and quite different from those o f isotropic
materials. In this study, the influence o f environmental temperature on
fatigue response o f Plain Weave Woven Carbon Fabric reinforced
Composite Plastic was examined. The 8 ply laminates were obtained from
epoxy resin prepreg fabric layers, stacked in two different sequences
producing unidirectional [0]s and angle plied [0,0,45, 45j s orientations.
The fatigue tests were carried out at  20°C, 0°C, 24°C, 100°C, and 150°C.
Enhanced dye penetrant X ray radiography and Scanning Electron
Microscope Fractography was used to characterize the fatigue damag.
The fiber/matrix interface strength, that is the most critical parameter in
initiation o f primary matrix cracks and interply delamination was found to
vary with testing temperature. It was found that there was no change in
sequence o f damage events but duration o f each event and hence
cumulative damage rates were different with varying temperatures. The
fatigue life at elevated temperature was found to decrease with increasing
temperature but decreasing temperature below ambient conditions caused
an increase in fatigue life fo r both classes o f woven laminates. An
analytical model used fo r CFRP life prediction based on Stiffness
Degradation during cyclic loading has been successfidly employed. A
parameter Dcritical (critical damage) that was a function o f testing
temperature and indicated the least stiffness value in Modulus
Degradation curves was introduced. A reasonably good correlation has
been obtained between predicted and experimental lives.
