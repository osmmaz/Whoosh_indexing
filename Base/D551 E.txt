The effect o f viscosity on the thermal effectiveness and entropy generation o f parallel
and counter flow heat exchangers was numerically investigated. The viscosity variations
with temperature in addition to the viscous friction were considered in the analysis for
different tube fluid inlet temperatures and different heat exchanger heat capacity rate
ratios.
The results show that viscosity causes significant deviations from the heat exchanger
performance obtained using the assumption that the viscous effects are negligible. As the
high viscosity fluid inlet temperature decreases, the effect o f viscosity becomes more
significant. However, the effect o f viscosity becomes smaller as the heat capacity rate
ratio decreases. It was found that an optimum heat exchanger size, at which the operation
o f the heat exchanger becomes most effective, could be determined. The results show also
that the effect o f viscosity on counter flow heat exchangers is smaller than its effect on
parallel flow heat exchangers.
