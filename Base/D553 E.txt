The term fouling is generally used to describe the deposition of unwanted (initially
fluid) particles, which increases both resistance to heat transfer and pressure drop
through the heat exchanger. CaCOz which is predominantly present in the cooling
water, has inverse solubility characteristics i.e., it is less soluble in warm water,
resulting in deposition of scales on heat transfer surfaces. A n experimental study
is carried out to determine the effect of tube surface temperature, Reynolds num ­
ber, tube diameter and scaling salt concentration on the induction time of CaCOz
scaling. It was observed that tube surface temperature, Reynolds number and tube
diameter have no effect on the onset time of the scaling whereas salt concentration
and tube surface roughness have a profound influence on the induction period. The
effect of tube surface temperature, Reynolds number, tube diameter and salt concentration
on the growth rate of fouling has also been studied. It was concluded that
for the range of parameters studied Reynolds number does not influence the fouling
resistance substantially. However, the tube surface temperature, tube diameter
and salt concentration have profound effect on the growth rate of scaling. The data
collected from the experiments are used to develop dimensionless fording resistance
models for estimation and prediction purpose.
