There is a prioritization of team work in construction organizations to accomplish their
projects in a prosperous manner. This is believed to be crucial on account of complexities
and risks entangled with construction work which can be further aggravated in the
absence of teamwork. Hence there exists an extreme need in construction organizations to
work in teams to undertake challenges which necessitate intensified technical skills with
appropriate planning. However, working in teams is just not sufficient as teams in
construction firms exist for years but members are not acquainted with a way to build and
work as an effective team. This is a basis for organizations to suffer losses in terms of
profit, productivity and resources.
