Construction equipment is a major resource in the building process for a construction
project. When equipment is owned by a contractor, it forms a sizable portion o f his assets
requiring proper management practices.
The objective o f this thesis is to study the equipm ent management practices o f major
contractors in the Eastern Province o f Saudi Arabia, to present the most popular practices o f the
contractors and to compare the equipment m anagem ent policies o f contractors in Saudi Arabia
with the management policies o f contractors in USA. The needed data were collected via a
structured questionnaire from 26 contractors out o f the 70 contractors in the population. The
contractors were divided into three grades based on their annual work volumes. The collected
data were analyzed using the SAS software, producing statistics, frequency and cross tabulation
charts. The elements o f the management policies were cross tabulated against the grades o f
contractors for finding possible significant differences in contractors’ practices. H ypotheses on
som e expected results were tested. Finally, the findings o f this study were com pared with
findings o f similar studies conducted in USA for finding significant com m onalties and
differences in equipment management practices.
Although only one third o f the contractors has written equipment m anagem ent policies
updated periodically, all contractors practice alm ost sim ilar equipm ent m anagem ent procedures
for selecting, acquiring, economic evaluation, operation and maintenance, record keeping,
standardization, and safety. It was interesting to notice that contractors in Saudi A rabia follow
procedures in managing equipment almost sim ilar to those procedures followed by contractors in
USA.
