Acetylene hydrogenation and formation of coke deposits were investigated on a
gold catalyst supported on  gold supported on alumina magnisia mixed oxide
xviii
The catalytic activity and selectivity towards ethylene and other products were
investigated at different reaction temperatures. Acetylene hydrogenation was investigated
in the presence and absence of ethylene in stream. It is investigated that the adsorption of
the triple bond is preferred over the double bond and during selective catalytic (SCR) of
C2H2 the two hydrocarbons do not compete for the same adsorption sites. The deactivation
of catalysts was studied by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). Higher content of
coke over  catalyst was investigated in contrast to the other catalysts in
which the basisity of magnesia alumina supports could have played an important role in
inhibiting the acidic carbon formation by possessing smaller number and or weaker acid
sites. Metallic gold nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 and magnesia alumina mixed
oxide, with different magnesia content have been prepared by sol gel method and
characterized by different techniques (inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS),
XRD, BET surface area analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CO2 and
NH3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), H2 temperature programmed reduction
(TPR) and FTIR of adsorbed CO2). Such systems were found to produce catalysts with
controllable acidity, varying from catalyst possessing large density of acidic and low
density of basic sites, others with acidic and basic sites of equal strength and density, and
others with large basic and low acid sites densities, respectively. The catalytic assessment
of the generated acidity was carried out using 2 propanol decomposition as a test reaction.
The results obtained indicate that the presence of magnesia and reduced gold
nanopartilces has imparted the catalysts, 
with significant base catalytic properties.
