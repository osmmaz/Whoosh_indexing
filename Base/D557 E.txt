Different FCC catalysts containing different Y zeolite unit cell sizes
were prepared. The effect of unit cell size o f Y  zeolite on their cracking
p erfo rm an ce h as been determ ined by X  ray d iffractio n , nitrogen
adsorption, and VGO cracking reaction using a m icroactivity test unit.
A cidity w as m easured by pyridine using tem perature program m ed
desorption (TPD). Y zeolites with unit cell size in the range o f 24.21 24.6
A were used as materials of FCC catalysts. The unit cell size was found to
be the m ajor factor that controls the FCC catalysts activity and selectivity.
The intrinsic activity was found to increase with unit cell size reaching a
m axim um at around 24.36 A then to decrease w ith unit cell size. The
isolated aluminum atoms (O NNN) were observed to have sim ilar behavior
with the unit cell size. Consequently, only (O NNN) aluminum atoms in the
zeolite are the active sites responsible for VGO cracking. Gasoline yield
was found to be a strong function of the unit cell size. It increases with the
unit cell size reaching a maximum and then decreasing. The decrease in
gasoline yield was accom panied with large increm ent in coke yield and
sm all increment in LPG yield. The increased coke yield with unit cell size
can be attributed to the increased 1,2,3,4 NNN aluminum atoms.
