The use of CNT in the production of rubber  nanocomposites have been on the increase
since they were discovered in early 1990s. This has been attributed to excellent physical
and mechanical properties which they posses. The use of CNT for reinforcement in
rubbers offers several advantages over mineral fillers such as carbon black and silicates.
For instance, little amount of CNT is required to obtain significant improvement while
for mineral fillers large amount is required for any significant improvement to be
observed. This often results in lightweight high performance materials. However, the use
of CNT as reinforcement filler in rubber is yet to be fully established as the
experimentally obtained results are still below theoretically predicted values.
Agglomeration of CNT, poor dispersion within the rubber matrix and poor interaction
between CNT and the matrix are some of the factors responsible for such observation. To
solve these problems and to improve on the performance of CNT as fillers, several steps
have been suggested. These include surface modification, sonication, use of solution
blending and in situ polymerization. In this study, the CNT surface was oxidized using
concentrated acid and subsequently functionalized using different (Octadecanol, Phenol
and Dodecylamine) surfactants. The effect of the oxidized CNT as well as each
functionalized CNT on the mechanical and thermal properties of natural rubber (RSS1)
was investigated.
