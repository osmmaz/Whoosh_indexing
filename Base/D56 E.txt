Echo is a debilitating problem fo r full duplex data transm ission over the telephone
network and hence m ust be cancelled. This echo tends to divide into two distinct
components which exhibit quite different characteristics. The recently proposed leastmean
mixed norms algorithm utilizes this difference to achieve a higher degree of
cancellation as compared to the single norm algorithm that is usually used. In this
thesis, the least mean m ixed norm s algorithm is studied fo r a general pair o f error
nonlinearities. In particular, the convergence o f the algorithm is studied and its
performance is evaluated fo r both correlated and independent identically distributed
inputs. The calculus o f variations is then used to determ ine the optimum pair of
nonlinearities fo r each input. These optimum nonlinearities are expressed in terms
of the additive noise probability density function (pdf). Approxim ating the pdf using
the Gram Charlier expansion provides a practical way fo r im plem enting the optimal
nonlinearities. A ll o f the above theoretical developments encompass and extend m any
existing results. Sim ulation was finally used to demonstrate the advantages o f the
least mean m ixed norm s algorithm over the single norm algorithm fo r half duplex
data transmission.
