The effects of diversity combining, coding, and equalization on the performance
of digital microcellular mobile communication systems, operating
over frequency selective fading channels, are studied using computer simulations.
The presence of co channel interference and additive white Gaussian
noise is assumed. The multiple access channel is statistically modelled
by Rician distributed plus lognormally shadowed desired signal and several
uncorrelated Rayleigh plus lognormally shadowed interfering signals, propagating
according to dual path loss law with a turning point. The modulation
schemes considered are BPSK, and DPSK. The channel is modeled by two
beams with a relative delay between them. The performance is determined
in terms of bit error rate (BER), and spectrum efficiency.
It is shown from the computer simulations done on the system that with
dual diversity combining and BPSK modulation the irreducible bit error
rate (IBER), due to co channel interference and intersymbol interference
(ISI), is reduced from 3.0 x 10 3 to 1.35 x 10 4. Also, with linear adaptive
equalization and BPSK modulation, the IBER is reduced to 8.0 x 10 4. The
use of Golay (23,12) code with BPSK modulation enhances the performance
of the system by 23.8 dB coding gain at 3.0 x 10 3 BER.
