The reduction in the usefiil service life of concrete structures in the Arabian
Gulf, due to chloride induced reinforcement corrosion, is of major concern to the
construction industry in this region. There are several options available to minimize
concrete deterioration due to reinforcement corrosion. Among these alternatives,
the use of good quality concrete is the cheapest one. However, it is difficult to
produce good quality concrete locally, as the available limestone aggregates are
weak and highly absorptive. Therefore, there is a need to improve the quality  of
concrete by suitable adjustments in the mix design. Further, the performance of
high quality  concrete when exposed to thermal variations is not very well
documented.
This research was conducted to develop high quality concrete utilizing local
aggregates. Three types of coarse aggregates, namely limestone aggregates from
Abu Hadriyah and Riyadh, and steel slag aggregates were selected to produce high
quality concrete. The tensile strength and reinforcement corrosion of the high
quality concrete produced using local aggregates were investigated.
The data developed in this research indicate that the quality of aggregate has a
significant effect on the corrosion resistance o f concrete. The steel slag aggregate
concrete showed better corrosion resistance and tensile strength followed by
Riyadh and Abu Hadriyah aggregate concretes. Exposure to thermal variations
reduced the corrosion resistance of reinforced concrete specimens prepared with the
selected aggregates.
The service life of the concrete prepared with the selected aggregates was
predicted using two models, namely B azanf s mathematical model and Morinaga
empirical formula. The highest service life was recorded in the concrete specimens
prepared with steel slag aggregates, silica fume and steel fibers.
