A high pressure reactor system for studying catalytic
hydroprocessing reactions was constructed and tested. The
autoclave was used as a liquid phase batch slurry reactor
for investigating the individual and simultaneous effects
of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and water on the kinetics of
catalytic hydrogenation of propylbenzene. Experiments
were carried out at 330, 350 and 375 °C under a hydrogen
pressure of 1000 psig. with NiMo/A^O^ commercial
hydrotreating catalyst. The catalyst was used either in
oxide form or after presulfiding it in the laboratory.
The partial pressures of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and
water was kept at about 100 mm Hg. each (for the
experiments in which their presence was needed). About 1
wt  of propylbenzene was taken in n hexadecane. Liquid
samples were analysed by Gas Chromatography.
Propylcyclohexane was the only product of propylbenzene
hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of propylbenzene over
both oxide and sulfided catalysts was observed to follow
pseudo first order kinetics in propylbenzene under all
conditions studied. Results showed that due to the
presence of hydrogen sulfide, the hydrogenation rate was
reduced by 10 15  . Filling of sulfur anion vacancies is
postulated as the cause for this effect. In the presence

of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, the rate was inhibited by
44.7  at 330 °C, 42.8  at 350 °C and 36.4  at 375 °C.
This increase in inhibition is due to the competitive
adsorption of highly basic ammonia on the acidic sites.
Addition of water to hydrogen sulfide and ammonia does not
influence the rate of hydrogenation. Comparision of oxide
and sulfided forms of NiMo/A^Oj catalyst showed that the
hydrogenation activity enhances by 20 25 times due to
sulfiding. All apparent activation energies were found to
be in the range of 17 21 kcal/gmol.
