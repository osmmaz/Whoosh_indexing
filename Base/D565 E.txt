Sabkha soil is widely spread in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly along the Arabian
Gulf and Red sea coasts. This soil is associated with some geotechnical problems due to
its water sensitivity, low load carrying capacity and chemical instability. Because o f these
inferior characteristics, roads constructed on sabkha terrains are subjected to deterioration
in the form o f raveling, cracking, rutting, formation o f potholes and depressions.
The main objective of this research is to upgrade the load carrying capacity of
pavements constructed on sabkha soils using geotextiles, and to assess the effect o f
geotextile grade, base thickness, loading type (static and dynamic) and moisture condition
(as molded and soaked) on the performance o f soil fabric aggregate (SFA) systems. In
addition, the sabkha soil was treated with different percentages (5, 7, and 10 ) of
Portland cement and the performance of cement stabilized sabkha was compared to that
o f SFA system under different testing conditions. All systems were evaluated by
measuring load carrying capacity at a given value o f permanent deformation at the
surface o f the graded base layer under both as molded and soaked conditions, taking into
account the different testing parameters.
The results of this program indicated that the use o f geotextile in the construction o f
roads on sabkha subgrades will have a beneficial effect on their load carrying capacities,
especially under wet conditions. The sabkha system with geotextile can carry much
higher loads compared to the system without the geotextile, especially under soaked
conditions. The improvement in the load carrying capacity o f sabkha samples with five
percent Portland cement was lower than the ones with A 400 geotextile. However,
samples with 7 and 10 percent cement additions showed better results than the inclusion
o f geotextile.
