Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used with polymers from date of
their inception to make composites having remarkable properties and materials. In
this work, the nanocomposites were prepared by blending the CNTs with high density
polyethylene (HDPE) using brabender mixing machine at various loadings (1 wt , 3
wt , and 5 wt ). The blending was repeated for the surfactants (CNTs/COOH,
CNTs/C18, and CNTs/PHENOL). The surface morphology of CNTs and their
functional groups were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A significant improvement on mechanical
properties of HDPE/CNTs nanocomposites were observed by increasing the loading
of raw and functionalized CNTs. From thermal analysis study, it was found that the
melting and crystallization temperatures of the composites are slightly affected by the
addition of raw and functionalized CNTs. However, clear enhancements on the
degree of crystallization of the nanocompopsites by adding 1 wt  of CNTs while
further increase in the amounts of raw and functionalized CNTs caused a clear
reduction in the degree of crystallization. From rheological characterization, the
complex viscosity was lowered at 1wt  loading and increased with addition of
xv
raw and functionalized CNTs. Likewise, the storage modulus (G') was found to be
increased in all the nanocomposites with the increasing in the CNTs contents. The
corresponding increase in the loss moduli (G'') in all HDPE nanocomposites is much
lower than for the storage moduli and there is no evidence for the formation of a
plateau.
