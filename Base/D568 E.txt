In this work, Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were functionalized with carboxylic ( COOH), Phenol ( phenolic), Octadecanol (C18) and Dodecyamie ( amine) groups and characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The composites of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and MWCNT (iPP/MWCNT) was prepared in the melt state using co rotating twin screw mini extruder. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the nanocomposites composites containing 1.0 wt.  CNTs loading indicates uniformed fractured morphology of nanotubes modified by phenolic group followed by nanotubes modified with Carboxylic. On the other hand, C18 and amine modification shows clusters and fiber like chunked fractured surface owing to aggregate formation and poor dispersion. The tensile properties of these composite were observed to increase with nanotubes loadings (0.1, 0.25, 1.00 and 5.00 wt.  ) with a highest Young Modulus and tensile stress at 1.0 wt.  nanotubes loading. Moreover, in similitude with the SEM images, phenol modified MWCNTs gave better mechanical properties followed by MWCNT COOH and MWCNT C18. Nanotubes modified with amine

gave the least of enhancement in mechanical properties. The DSC analysis shows the nucleating effect of all the CNTs on the iPP matrix except for MWCNT amine which shows no shift in DSC thermogram was observed at various nanotubes loadings. Overall degree of crystallinity changes with addition of MWCNT COOH and MWCNT Phenol whereas no changes in the degree of crystallinity were observed from MWCNT C18 and MWCNT amine.
