The Internal Model Control (IMC) structure is composed o f the explicit model o f the
plant and a stable feed forward controller. The major task for the IMC design is to fin d a
precise model o f the plant. In this work, Takagi Sugeno fuzzy modeling is used to
approximate nonlinear systems. Modeling by linearization is employed at certain
operating points and separate local linear models are obtained. The Takagi Sugeno fuzzy
model is constructed to fuzzily switch among the local linear models. In order to obtain a
more precise model, a normalized least mean square algorithm is added in parallel to the
fuzzy model to adaptively quantify for the model mismatch. An adaptive inverse control
concept using adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filters has been used to implement
the feedforward controller part o f the IMC structure.
