Predicting the effects of reservoir and well parameters on the performance of
horizontal and vertical wells in retrograde gas condensate reservoirs is important in
determining the well type needed in a given formation. Due to increased number of
horizontal wells drilled in retrograde gas condensate reservoirs, there is a necessity for
better and improved understanding of the behavior and performance of this type of wells in
retrograde gas condensate reservoirs.
The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effects of reservoir and well
parameters on the performance of horizontal and vertical wells in volumetric retrograde
gas condensate reservoirs using three dimensional, single well compositional reservoir
simulation model. To simulate the depletion processes, the single well compositional
reservoir simulation model is used to investigate the effects of reservoir and well
parameters such as horizontal permeability, reservoir thickness, ratio of vertical to
XVII
horizontal permeability (kv/kh), and horizontal well penetration ratio on the performance of
horizontal and vertical wells.
Results indicate that, for the vertical well, the lower the values of horizontal
permeability and formation thickness, the higher the average reservoir pressure at
abandonment time. For the horizontal well, the lower the values of formation permeability,
formation thickness, kv/kh ratio, and horizontal well penetration ratio, the higher the
average reservoir pressure at abandonment time. The lower the values of horizontal
permeability and formation thickness, and the higher the value of kv/kh and horizontal well
penetration ratio, the better the performance of horizontal well over the performance of
vertical well.
Simple algebraic equations are presented that can be used to calculate the
abandonment time as a function of well and reservoir parameters. Results presented in
tabular form can be used by reservoir engineers in order to select the appropriate well type
in a given reservoir, to determine the recovery factors for gross gas, free gas and oil, and to
determine the abandonment pressure and abandonment time.
