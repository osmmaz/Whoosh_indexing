Contractor prequalification models and prequalification criteria (PQC) were studied
through extensive literature review to determine their respective working methodologies.
These prequalification models were segregated into two groups namely “Practical” and
“Theoretical” groups. Further attention was devoted to the former group and the
prequalification models comprising of the first group were further analyzed to determine
the different levels of methodology sophistication and complexity. Then three
prequalification models were selected representing the different levels of complexity.
These models were then subjected to a comparison analysis which comprised not only of
the quantitative comparison but also of the qualitative aspect. Conclusions were drawn on
the basis of this comparison analysis. One of the important conclusions drawn was that
agreement between the various prequalification models was based more on the extent of
objectivity used in making decisions rather than in the inherent methodologies of the
models. The difference in the models is the ease with which decisions were elicited from
the user.
