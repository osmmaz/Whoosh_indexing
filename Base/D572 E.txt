Testing systems on a chip (SOC) involves applying huge amounts of test data, which
is stored in the tester memory and then transferred to the circuit under test (CUT)
during test application. Therefore, practical techniques, such as compression and
compaction, are required to reduce the amount of test data in order to reduce both
the total testing time and the memory requirements for the tester. Some of the existing
compression/compaction techniques require the test data to be partially specified,
while others can benefit from partially specified test sets either directly or by specifying
the don’t care values in these test sets in a way that improves their efficiency.
One obvious way to extract the don’t care values in the test sets is to test for the
possibility of changing every bit in the test set to an X based on fault simulation.
This is called bitwise relaxation. In this thesis, we propose a novel and efficient test
relaxation technique for synchronous sequential circuits. The proposed technique is
faster than the bitwise relaxation method by several orders of magnitude.
