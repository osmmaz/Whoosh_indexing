The significant advancement in VLSI technology has made System On Chip (SOC) designs very popular. One
o f the most challenging problems in testing SOCs is dealing with the large volume o f test data. There have
been two methods to release this problem, namely, test compaction and test compression. Many compression
techniques assume relaxed test set in order to achieve high compression ratios. In this work, we address the
problem o f generating a relaxed test set from a given test set. A Bitwise Relaxation (BR) technique can be
used to solve this problem. However, the BR technique is very slowfor large circuits. Another way to obtain a
relaxed test set is to generate the test set using dynamic compaction technique. Dynamic compaction is slow
as well, and generating the relaxed test set using this method slows down the ATPG process. Furthermore,
dynamic compaction can not be used to relax an existing test set. Thus, the only existing solution to the test
relaxation problem is the BR method. In this work, we propose three efficient techniques to solve the test
set relaxation problem. We also propose cost functions to guide the selection in maximizing the number o f
extracted x's. The proposed techniques are faster than the BR method by several orders o f magnitude. They
also obtain comparable results with the BR method.
