Advances in the semi conductor process and design technology have paved th e way
for system on chips (SoCs). Traditional IC design in which every circuit is designed
from scratch and reuse is lim ited only to standard cell libraries is more and more replaced
by the SoC design methodology. However, this new design m ethodology has
its own challenges. A m ajor challenge is to reduce the increasing volume of test data.
Basically, there are two approaches: compression and compaction. In this thesis, the
problems of static com paction and test vector reordering for com binational circuits
are investigated. A new class of static com paction algorithm s referred to as test
vector decomposition (T V D ) is introduced. Two new static com paction algorithm s
based on TVD are proposed. Besides, the use of the critical path tracing algorithm
as a fault sim ulator in test vector reordering procedures is proposed. Experim ental
results are provided to dem onstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm s.
