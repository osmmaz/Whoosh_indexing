Complexity of IC design test at nanom eter scale integration has increased tremendously.
Scan based design test strategy is the m ost widely used solution to achieve
the high level of fault coverage desired fo r such complex designs, in particular for
the SoC based design paradigm. However, test data volume, test application time
and power consumption have increased proportionately with integration scale and so
has, ultimately, the cost of test. Scan based test alone does not offer much fo r these
problems. Test data compression techniques have been increasingly used recently to
cope with this problem. This work proposes an effective reconfigurable broadcast scan
compression scheme that employs partitioning and relaxation based test vector decomposition.
Given a constraint on the number of tester channels, the technique
classifies the test set into acceptable and bottleneck vectors. Bottleneck vectors are
then decomposed into a set of vectors that meet the given constraint. The acceptable
and decomposed test vectors are partitioned into the smallest number of partitions
while satisfying the tester channels constraint to reduce the decompressor area. Thus,
the technique by construction satisfies a given tester channels constraint at the expense
of increased test vector count and number of partitions, offering a tradeoff between
test compression, test application time and test decompression circuitry area.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves significantly
higher test volume reductions in comparison to other test compression techniques.
