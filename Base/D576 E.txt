Two fundam ental techniques o f fonts representation are bitmap and outline. The
outline fon ts are produced from a gray level image obtained by scanning the original
characters drawn on paper. Contour points are obtained from the gray level
image and significant points are determined from contour points. Splines are approximated/
interpolated to these significant points.
In traditional fo n t design systems, the user specifies significant points by some
interactive device (e.g. mouse). The system then generates a curve whose shape
depends on specified points and mathematical model of the curve. There are several
drawbacks of this method. The user has to be fam iliar with the underlying mathematical
model of the system in order to use it properly. Human intervention and
changing set of points many times makes this method slow. Accuracy up to desired
tolerance lim it is difficult to achieve.
We proposed an efficient font design method that automate the process of font
design by finding m inim al number o f significant points , removing noise from contour,
fitting cubic Bezier to significant points and Optimizing the closeness o f fit between
original digitized curve and our parametric curve.
