Characterizing the distribution of the sum of lognormal random variables (RVs) is
still an open issue; it appears in a variety of fields and has been the target objective of
many papers. In wireless communications, it arises in analyzing the total power received
from several interfering sources. Recent advances in this field allow for the efficient
computations of the distribution of a low number of individual RV components or for low
value of the decibel spread corresponding to the individual RV. This work attempts to
explore methods that are more efficient and easier in evaluating the distribution function
for the sum of lognormal RVs. Previous research works in the area of wireless codexiii
division multiple access (CDMA) data networks have shown that the cell site traffic
power can be modeled as the sum of RVs that are very similar to lognormal RVs. This
work also aims to apply the developed computation to the problem of characterizing the
cell site power for CDMA system.
