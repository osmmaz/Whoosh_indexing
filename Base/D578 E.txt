In wireless sensor networks, sensors are densely deployed. The number of sensors deployed is usually higher than optimum required due to the lack of precise sensor placement, especially when the interest region is inaccessible. Thus it is possible to turn some sensors off while guaranteeing the complete coverage of the interest region.
Coverage is one of the fundamental issues in wireless sensor networks. For the coverage problem, one must ensure that the interest region is under monitor all time although some sensor nodes may fail. It's an important design objective to maximize the network lifetime by minimizing energy consumed in the sensor networks.

In this thesis some algorithms proposed recently for coverage in literature are discussed. After a review on them, RID is selected  random Independent deployment  that will be suitable for the new model and fits for applications of dense deployment in hostile fields. The Kumar analytical model for RID is programmed. After that simulation is done for the new model and an efficient scheduling scheme is applied to maximize lifetime of the sensor networks by deploying Satellite node(SN). The new model called SWSN (satellite wireless sensor networks). The new scheme is compared with the old one and find SWSN system will be not visible if it use the SN for sending data to satellite. Thus, because SN consume huge power but still it is a good if we use continues power source. In addition, SWSN&WSN are combined by send request by satellite and the replay will return by the old system and find this will decrees the consumption of the power in communication by 50  not in this only but at all the WSN.
