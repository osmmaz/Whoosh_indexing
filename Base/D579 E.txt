The problem of detecting collision between moving rigid objects in three dimensional space is
considered. Two efficient algorithms that use linear programming technique are developed for
solving this problem. The algorithms can detect exactly all possible collisions for objects moving
on a general path in Si3 with simultaneous translation and rotation. Computational experience
with the developed algorithms is also presented.
The potential field approach to the path planning problem is also considered. A new potential
function that has the remarkable feature that it is free from any local minima in the free space
for any number of obstacles in the work space is developed. Furthermore, a new approach to
path optimization using an expanding sphere is also proposed. The new potential function is
tested using a point mobile robot and smooth obstacles.
