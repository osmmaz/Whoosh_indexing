Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one type of nondestructive testing (NDT)
methods where the material’s impedance is analyzed over wide range of frequencies and based
on the impedance parameters, the material quality in terms of corrosion rate is determined. In
this thesis, two different approaches for estimating the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies
(EIS) are presented which are High Order Statistic (HOS) based deconvolution and Adaptive
Filtering (AF). These two methods are proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the existing EIS
techniques in terms of noise sensitivity in the case of time domain methods and the slow process
speed in the case of frequency domain methods. The HOS based method treats the impedance
spectrum as the unknown system frequency response in a convolution problem. Given the input
signal (applied signal) and the response signal (output signal), the impedance spectrum could be
estimated by the HOS based deconvolution using the third order moments of both the input and
output signals. For the AF based method, the impedance spectrum is measured by estimating the
parameters of the equivalent circuit representing the impedance system. Each proposed
approach is analyzed with different material models and different noise statistics that usually
corrupt the measurement data. MATLAB simulations and experimental results are used in the
performance assessment of the two proposed methods as well as comparisons with existing
methods. In comparison with the existing methods, it is shown that the proposed algorithms
perform very efficiently even with the present of Gaussian and non Gaussian distributed noises
at low signal to noise ratio (SNR).
