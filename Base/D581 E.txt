The attractive stripping performance of nucleic acid constituents were
characterized at different carbon composite electrode surfaces. A simple, sensitive and
reliable electrochemical method was developed for the investigation and analytical
determination of adenine (A), guanine (G), adenosine (AS) and guanosine (GS) at
different composite carbon electrode surfaces. Different electroanalytical techniques
were used as cyclic voltammetry (CV), square wave stripping voltammetry (SWV),
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Factors
influencing the trace detection of these compounds at glassy carbon paste (GCP), glassy
carbon (GC) and graphite pencil (GP) composite electrode surfaces were assessed.
All developed methods were optimized and the figures of merit were determined.
The possibility of the detection in biological samples, interference of common organic
compounds, and direct determination of ssDNA were tested successfully. Finally the
developed methods were compared to HPLC.
