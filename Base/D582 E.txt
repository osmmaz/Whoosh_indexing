Phenol and chlorophenol derivatives were electrochemically investigated on the surface
of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave
adsorptive stripping voltammetry (SWASV) at optimum pH of 0.1 M phosphate buffer
solutions. The obtained results indicated that phenol, 2 chlorophenol, 2,4 dichlorophenol,
2,6 dichlorophenol, 2,4,6 trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, with no exception,
exhibit fouling effects as a result of first oxidized irreversible phenoxy radical products.
At the same time, phenol and all studied chlorophenol derivatives, except
pentachlorophenol, showed isomerization peaks. Such peaks were obtained all at once at
a single scan via the selection of the right value for accumulation potential. The typical
oxidation peak of 2 chlorophenol was obtained by fixing the accumulation potential at
+0.40 V, where the isomerize peaks were obtained with relatively much higher signals by
accumulation at +1.10 V. Both peaks were optimized for possible analytical
determination. Detection limits of 18.99 M (2.44 ppm) and 1.11 (140 ppb) were
obtained from monitoring the conventional and the isomerize peak respectively. Relative
standard deviation of 1.84  and 1.31  for seven repeated measurement at the same
concentration were obtained for the conventional and isomerized peaks of 2 chlorophenol
respectively. The current study proved that the well known phenol surface
passivation/fouling effect is no longer a failure, and can be useful for more sensitive
electroanalytical determination of phenol and phenol derivatives.
