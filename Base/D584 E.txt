In this MS Thesis, electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide has been studied on high
surface area multi walled carbon nano tubes (MWCNT) supported nickel oxide and tin
oxide catalysts. Both the nickel and tin oxides catalysts were synthesized by direct
impregnation method with different loading of metal content to get 10  , 20  , 30   and
40   metal oxide loaded on the support. The prepared catalysts were characterized using
XRD and SEM EDX determining the crystalline size, surface morphology, dispersion
and metal oxide content on the support. Both XRD and SEM analysis shows that
increase in the metal oxide content results in the poor dispersion due to agglomeration of
the metal crystals. Electrochemical evaluation of the catalysts was carried out in a half
cell (H cell) and in an electrochemical reactor for carbon dioxide reduction. Linear
sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) techniques were employed to
study the electrochemical behavior of the catalysts. Half cell reaction setup was used to
identify the optimum loading of the catalyst among the prepared sample. Based on LSV
and CA for the carbon dioxide reduction process it was found that with the 20  
NiO/MWCNT and 20   SnO2/MWCNT catalysts optimum reaction rate. The selected
catalyst, 20   NiO/ MWCNT was further evaluated in the electrochemical reactor. The
products obtained were mainly CO and H2. The maximum faradaic efficiency obtained
with 20   NiO /MWCNT was at a potential of  1.7 V vs. NHE.
