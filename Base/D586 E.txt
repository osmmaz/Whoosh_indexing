A large and complex CO gas clean up system is usually required to bring down carbon
monoxide content in reformate gas to acceptable levels for fuel cell application ( < 1 0
ppm). Recently an electrochemical filter has been proposed promising to simplify the gas
clean up. In this device, a pulsating potential is applied to a conventional PEMFC, the
configuration results in preferential oxidation o f CO. The present work was undertaken to
investigate the possibility of replacing the expensive Pt catalyst with non noble metal
catalyst. It has been shown experimentally that CO adsorbs and electrooxidizes on
Ni/Raney Ni catalyst akin to Pt catalyst.
It has been found that CO present in the H2 gas gets adsorbed over the catalyst surface
causing delay in hydrogen evolution reaction and prevents the Ni dissolution. The
adsorbed CO was successfully removed by application of suitable anodic potential. It was
observed that almost 100   CO removal takes place from the electrode surface. The
amount of CO electrooxidized depends upon a number o f parameters such as CO
exposure time, CO flow rate, CO concentration, scan rate and catalyst loading. The effect
these parameters were investigated.
