Long hours of work while standing have been known to cause health problems for
humans. Such professions include that o f the barber. A survey was conducted in
barber shops in the Dhahran area to determine the discomfort level of barbers. A
workstation was then designed and constructed in which the barber sits and performs
work. The workstation was tested by experiments by ten barbers in the Systems
engineering dept, at K.F.U.P.M. These barbers were among those surveyed earlier in
their shops. Their discomfort level was again taken and an experiment was conducted
to find the shape o f the footrest. The barbers also evaluated the barbers chair through
a questionnaire. The discomfort levels obtained while standing and sitting were
statistically analysed. From the results, it was concluded that the mean of the
discomfort level while standing tends to be higher. A survey of five commercially
available customer chairs was also conducted and analysed as a ease study in Saudi
Arabia.
