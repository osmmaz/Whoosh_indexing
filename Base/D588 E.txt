The objective of this thesis is to enhance the insulation capability (Increasing the
breakdown voltage) in SF6 CBs by reducing the electric field concentration inside the
insulation medium. To achieve that, the electric field Problem in the SF6 CB is
formulated as an optimization problem. Two artificial intelligence techniques namely:
particle swarm (PS) and simulated annealing (SA) where used to solve the objective
function. A combined ANSYS Artificial intelligence algorithms have been proposed.
The effectiveness of the newly proposed electric field optimization algorithms has been
tested successfully on two SF6 CB’s (252 kV and 550 kV) reported in the literature. The
performance of the proposed methods outperformed the optimization results reported
before.
Not only the electric field is highly reduced using the proposed algorithms but also the
computational time is reduced too. Furthermore the effect of space charge on the
performance of the proposed algorithms has been studied.
