As a primary aim of this study, solution procedures have been developed for
nonlinear analysis of Single M itre d B end s. An analysis of single mitred
bends made of anisotropic material typical of metal matrix has also been
considered. An assumed displacement finite element approach, based on the
degenerate shell concept that incorporates bending extensional coupling and
some measure of transverse shear deformation, is adopted . Attention has
been devoted to achieving a computationally efficient mesh and an accurate
numerical integration across the thickness of the single mitred bend.
A special purpose computer program P L A M B S 7 has been developed.
A number of problems have been analyzed and results compared with solutions
elsewhere in the literature. The range of problems included elastic,
elasto plastic, and elasto anisottopic single mitred bends under pressure or
in plane bending. For the bending load, the effect of large deformation in
relation to opening and closing moments on the elasto plastic response of the
mitre model has been explored.
