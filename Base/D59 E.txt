The prediction o f software development effort from early software estimates is a
challenging task because not much o f the information about the software is available at
that time. Moreover, the information gathered fo r software attributes from various
sources is subjective to imprecision and uncertainty. Imprecision arises when an expert
defines some qualitative criteria to differentiate between two or more classes.
Uncertainty arises due to the existence o f more than one metric fo r a particular attribute.
This uncertainty leads to the uncertainty in software effort prediction. This thesis
presents a type 2 FLS based effort prediction framework that is capable o f handling
imprecision and uncertainty. In addition, empirical studies regarding the impact o f
various parameters o f FLS on effort prediction system are carried out. The thesis also
identifies a set o f attributes that can give indication o f the credibility o f existing size
metrics; and uses these attributes to evaluate some existing software size metrics.
