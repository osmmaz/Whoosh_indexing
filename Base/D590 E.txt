The behavior of steel frames is highly influenced by the beam column connections. In
analysis and design, they are idealized as either rigid or pinned for simplicity and
between these two extremities lie the actual behavior of steel frames connections
which is semi rigid. This classification is characterized by the nonlinear momentrotation
relationship which must be incorporated in the analysis. Cap plate connection
is widely used in industrial steel frames for its advantages over other types of building
connections, but the response of such connection has not been theoretically and
experimentally determined.
In this research, the behavior of cap plate connections was studied by testing
six different connections to obtain data for moment rotation curves of such
connections, to measure the forces in the tension bolts, and to measure the strain
distribution at different cross section along the beam at the connection. A computer
program was developed for a refined analysis of industrial steel frames taking into
consideration the nonlinearities resulting from the connection flexibility and secondorder
effects. A mathematical model for the connection moment rotation curve is also
proposed using the finite element method and the yield line method. A good
agreement was found by comparing the proposed model results to the experimental
results.
