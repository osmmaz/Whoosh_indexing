In hot climates, the building envelope plays a crucial role in determining the building
thermal and energy performance. Windows in particular play an important role in
determining space cooling loads and also for the integration of artificial lighting and
daylighting that can result in a significant energy reduction. Conventional windows while
providing daylighting do not have any control over solar heat gain and visual discomfort
resulting from glare. On the other hand, smart windows can be automatically tuned to
control the glare level and consequently the amount of daylight and heat passing through
the window. The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of smart window
design on energy and visual performance in office buildings under hot climatic
conditions.
To achieve the objective, the energy simulation program DesignBuilder was used to
model a theoretical office building with conventional glass windows like clear, tinted and
low e. Low e windows with daylight integration were found to be the most effective
conventional glazing for reducing the building energy consumption. While automated
venetian blinds as interior shading with solar controller reduced the building energy
consumption by 16 . Three control techniques namely daylight, glare and solar are
assessed and were used for altering the properties of smart windows. The analysis shows
that replacing low e windows with Electrochromic (EC) smart windows with daylight
control resulted in the reduction of building energy consumption by 23 , but without
satisfying the visual comfort. EC windows with glare control reduced the overall building
energy consumption by 17 , satisfying the visual comfort. EC window with solar
controller reduced the building energy consumption by 20 , and satisfying the visual
comfort.
