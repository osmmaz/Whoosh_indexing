This study deals with energy and exergy analyses of crude oil distillation plants. In
these plants, high degree of irreversibilities (exergy losses) occur. These losses cannot
be identified by the first law of thermodynamics (energy analysis) only as it is a
measure of quantity only whereas the second law of thermodynamics (exergy
analysis) is a measure of quality as well as quantity. Exergy analysis appears to be a
potential tool to determine the losses. In refinery distillation plants, there are many
components of interest to be analyzed thermodynamically, e.g. the crude oil heating
furnace, the distillation column and a network of heat exchangers. The previous
literature works were mainly concerned with the yield percentage of the distillation
plant and to some extent the energy efficiency, no detailed work was done using
exergy analysis. In this study, crude oil distillation plants are modeled and analyzed
thermodynamically with the aid of simulation software (SimSci/PRO II) to determine
the energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and irreversibility rate of the individual
components and the overall system. Effects of temperature profile and pressure profile
of the distillation columns on the efficiencies and irreversibility rates are illustrated.
Also, effect of modifying the conventional crude oil distillation plant is studied. Those
modifications are pump back circuits instead of pump around circuits, adding reboiler
to the distillation column and two stage distillation columns. Results showed that
operating conditions are the optimum conditions yielding the highest efficiencies and
lowest irreversibility rates. Modifying the conventional model lead to an increase up
to 58  for the system overall efficiency and decreases down to 40  system overall
irreversibilities.
