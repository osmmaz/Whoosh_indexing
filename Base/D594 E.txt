The design and actual thermodynamic performance of Ghazlan power plant have
been studied based on both first and second  law analysis. A comparison between the two
performances indicated that there is a room for improvements. Being encouraged by this
and the fact that a 1  improvement in performance will result in saving of millions of
Saudi Riyals per year, a full exergy analysis is carried out to identify the potentials for
improving the plant performance. The exergy analysis shows a detailed breakdown of
exergy losses of the different components in the plant. Hence based on the results of the
analysis, several alternative arrangements to improve the plant efficiency were considered.
This included the plant turbine cycle operation under various conditions. In this regard, the
thermodynamic physical quantities whose effects were studied are: throttle steam pressure
and temperature, reheat steam pressure and temperature for a single reheat, double reheat,
reheat pressure for a double reheat and number of feedwater heaters. The results o f the
study are presented in tabular and graphical forms and discussed in detail.
