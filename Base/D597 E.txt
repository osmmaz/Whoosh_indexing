Algorithm based fault tolerance has been proposed as a technique to detect incorrect
computations in multiprocessor systems. In algorithm based fault tolerance, processors
produce data elements that are checked by concurrent error detection mechanisms. Error
detecting codes are designed to detect errors with a degree of detectability left to the end
user. In this thesis, v/e propose new 3 ED (3 Error Correcting) codes that are more efficient
than the 3 ED codes currently available in the literature. We also study lower bounds for
t ED codes, and propose a general f ED codes construction. In addition, we introduce a
new family of codes: single error locating / double error detecting (1 EL/2 ED) codes, for
which a general construction is proposed. The proposed codes are compared with codes
found by computer search to verify optimality.
