Corrosion of reinforcing steel, mainly caused by chloride ions, is the number one
durability problem faced by the construction industry. There is a desire to develop a nondestructive
concrete corrosion monitor to determine the concentration of chloride ions in
concrete. The Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) technique offers a
prompt, non destructive, in situ technique to detect the elemental composition of concrete.
Therefore, a PGNAA setup will be designed and tested to detect prompt gamma rays
reflected from concrete specimens. Monte Carlo calculations will be carried out to
determine the optimum size of the neutron moderator, sample and detector shielding.
The chloride concentration was measured in chloride contaminated FA, BFS and SPZ
cement concrete specimens at 6.11, 5.72 and 2.86+3.10 MeV chlorine prompt gamma
rays. In spite of interference between gamma rays from chlorine and calcium, an excellent
agreement was observed between the experimental and theoretical yield of 6.11, 5.72 and
2.86+3.10 MeV chlorine prompt gamma rays. This shows the successful application of
the portable neutron generator for evaluating the chloride contamination in the field.
A good correlation was noted between the gamma ray yield at 5.72 and 6.11 MeV.
Consequently, the chloride concentration can be determined from these relations:
Chloride (wt. ) = 5.72 MeV Gamma Ray Counts / 3839
Chloride (wt. ) = 6.11 MeV Gamma Ray Counts / 5293
However, the equation with 6.11 MeV is preferred as it has higher intensity and can detect
low concentrations of chloride.
