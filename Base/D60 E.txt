Time varying behavior offading channels can cause severe degradations o f the system’s
performance. Coding and Diversity are found to be efficient techniques to improve the
performance o f faded systems. Typically, diversity channels are used to provide the
receiver replicas o f transmitted signal. In this thesis, we will utilize the available
diversity channels by incorporating forward error correction coding in an adaptive way
in order to minimize the bit error rate o f the system. Minimization o f the overall error
probability will be considered to determine the optimum code rate to be used over each
channel based on its quality, subject to the constraint o f fixed overall throughput rate.
Both BCH and RS coding with hard decision decoding will be considered for the
purpose o f forward error correction. The performance o f this system over Rayleigh and
Nakagami m fading channel models will be studied by means o f computer simulation,
and by numerical calculations whenever possible. The effect o f channel correlation and
the impact o f outdated channel state information on the performance o f the system will
be also investigated.
