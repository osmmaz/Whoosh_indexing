In this research, an artificial intelligence (AI) model has been created to estimate the
production rate of each layer in a multi layered gas reservoir using static properties such as
those obtained from well logging, in addition to dynamic properties such as pressure. This
approach will be helpful in several reservoir engineering applications, such as
understanding layers’ depletion, or targeting specific layers for workover. It could also be
used for PLT analysis where the measured PLT values are compared to the expected values
and a variance analysis could be performed.
Data were collected from more than 100 wells in a certain reservoir spanning over four
fields. They were combined in related input variables and fed to the AI model for learning
purposes. To compare different AI methods, the data were fed to 5 methods, namely ANFIS,
MLP, RBF, SVM, and GRNN, and results were optimized for each method.
Between the tested AI methods, SVM and GRNN performed best as shown by a low mean
absolute percentage error and a very high correlation coefficient. This research shows
promising use for AI methods in estimating production rate from each layer in a multilayered
gas reservoir.
