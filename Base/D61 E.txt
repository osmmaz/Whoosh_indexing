Software development effort prediction is one of the most critical activities
in managing software projects. Algorithmic effort prediction models, which
have dominated the software engineering community, are limited by their
inability to cope with uncertainties and imprecision surrounding software
projects early in the development life cycle. More recently, attention has
turned to a variety of machine learning methods, and soft computing in
particular to predict software development effort. There are evidences that
soft computing has been able to address some of the problems associated
with previous models. However, there is no common ground for assessing
and comparing these soft computing based prediction techniques. This thesis
presents an evaluation scheme for soft computing based effort prediction
techniques. We present a critical survey of the state of the art application of
soft computing in development effort prediction. Based on the survey results,
we propose and implement a transparent and adaptive fuzzy logic framework
for effort prediction.
