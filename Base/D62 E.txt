Multiple access interference (MAI) is considered the major air interference for the 3G
radio communication systems in which code division multiple access (CDMA) technique
is used for allocating certain number of users the same channel at the same time.
Canceling MAI is a major task in the 3G system. Multiuser detection (MUD) receivers
can provide better interference rejection than the conventional detector used in 2G
system (like IS 95). The optimal MUD detector which is the maximum likelihood detector
is too complex for practical implementation with today’s technology. Due to this
complexity, most of researches have focused on finding suboptimal low complexity
multiuser detectors solutions that are feasible to implement. In this thesis, we investigate
the performance of a new receiver structure which uses decision feedback equalizer
(DFE) as a multiuser detector. A modified DFE structure in which error feedback filter
(EFF) is added to the main structure is also investigated. The performance of these
proposed structures will be compared to the decorrelator detector (DD). The proposed
structure is shown to exhibit good MAI rejection as well as near far resistance.
