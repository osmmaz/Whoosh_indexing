The objective of this thesis is to develop an adaptive Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
controller to control water extraction of the Inline Surface Oil/Water Separator (ISOWS).
The thesis contains both a theoretical part and a practical part of the implementation of
the ANN controller. The definition of the process problem is briefly discussed to explain
the practical application of the ANN controller. An overview of the ANN types and the
calculations commonly used for training Feed Forward ANNs are given. More emphasis
is shown on the RBF Networks with online training. The practical part shows the detailed
implementation blocks of this project consisting of the system used to control water
extraction from the ISOWS, which includes water in oil detection probes, input
processing, ANN controller, anti windup routine, output processing, and the motoroperated 
valves (MOVs), which are controlled using the output parameters. The results
of the practical application of the ANN controller to the ISOWS are illustrated using
screen captures of the graphical interface of the developed software and a short video for
the actual operation and control of the ISOWS.
