Permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind generators gained popularity
over other variable speed devices because of their advantages in terms of simple rotor
design, lack of slip rings, no necessity for external excitation, higher efficiency, etc.
Though it performs satisfactorily under normal conditions, it is sensitive to sudden wind
gusts and also extremely low grid voltage conditions. This research considers
superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) control to improve the dynamic
performance of the PMSG system.
A dynamic model of the PMSG system with an SMES controller connected at the
inverter terminal is presented. The SMES controller strategy with variations of real power
and terminal voltage as the input has been derived. The performance of the controller
depends on the values of the controller gains and time constants when large excursions
are experienced by the system. An online adaptive strategy employing radial basis
function neural network (RBFNN) for updating the parameters of the SMES controller
has been presented. The nominal weights of the RBFNN have been created by presenting
the neural network from a large input output data set. The training data was created
through an improved particle swarm (IPSO) optimization technique.The proposed adaptive RBFNN SMES control strategy was tested on the PMSG wind
system for various disturbances like large torque pulses, wind gust and severe low
voltage conditions on the grid. It is observed that the SMES controller can damp the
power system oscillations effectively and restore normal operating conditions in
reasonable time. A proper selection of the weighting matrix obtained through IPSO and
radial basis function neural network helped adaptive algorithm to find the parameters
very fast.
