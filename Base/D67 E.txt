Performance measurement techniques/systems normally assume homogeneity
among decision making units (DMUs) where the units under evaluation share the
same characteristics. However, in practice, the units are not homogenous and
naturally fall into groups based on the nature of the business processes or
organizational structures. This implies that simple efficiency indicators cannot be
applied to assess the performance of such units and sub units.
Another issue faced with this type of problems is with the aggregation of the
performance measures. Normally, the efficiency evaluation of the unit depends on the
efficiency values of its sub units which require the assessment of the sub units in
order to evaluate the overall efficiency of the unit. However, since the units might not
have the same number of sub units and don’t share the same characteristics; simple
summation cannot be applied to aggregate the performance measures.
In this thesis, an AHP and DEA hybrid model has been developed for calculating
and aggregating performance measures in an organization with several units and subunits
considering their individual characteristics. In addition, the ranks of such units
and sub units were determined. The model was compared with other models and its
advantage in limiting the effect of zero weights problem is demonstrated.
