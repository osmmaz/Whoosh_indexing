Determination of hydrocarbon saturation is the vital parameter in oil reserve calculation
processes. Archie’s formula is the water saturation model for the determination of
hydrocarbon saturation. In carbonate rocks, Archie’s parameters become more sensitive
to pore system distribution and lithofacies properties. Consequently more attention must
be paid to the accuracy of Archie’s parameters in carbonate rocks. Uncertainty in these
parameters will lead to non acceptable errors in the water saturation values.
In this study three techniques are presented to determine Archie’s parameters using
carbonate core samples. These techniques are; conventional technique, CAPE technique
and 3D technique. The objective of this study is to calculate and analysis the Archie’s
parameters in order to get the accurate water saturation. Water saturation profiles, using
Archie’s parameters determined by the three techniques, have been produced for the
studied section in the well. These profiles have shown a significant difference in water
saturation values. This difference could be mainly attributed to the uncertainty level for
Archie’s parameters from each technique. Error analysis of these methods has been applied to adopt the suitable determination technique to better evaluation of Archie’s
parameters.
