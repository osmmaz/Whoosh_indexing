The complexity of state space based methods for analysis of finite user finite
buffer (FU FB) random multiple access systems increases exponentially with buffer
size and number of users. The presence of multipath frequency selective fading
channel further adds to the complexity, making the analysis practically intractable.
An approximate analysis technique called tagged user analysis (TUA) has been
used to analyze the performance parameters of such systems over multipath and
frequency selective fading channels for FU FB systems. In TUA, the steady state
system performance is evaluated from the analysis of a single user. Moreover, the
state flow graph of TUA has just four states; thus reducing the complexity of the
analysis. Simulation results confirm the validity of the TUA analysis.
The mathematical expressions for the pdf of the received signal impaired by interference signal power are developed. These results are used to find the prob 
ability that the transmission by the tagged user will be successful in presence of
interference. Random multiple access MAC protocols including S ALOHA, the
IEEE 802.11 DCF and EDCF based on CSMA/CA have been analysed. The
analysis is presented for realistic scenarios with a) a multipath frequency selec 
tive channel between the users/stations (STAs) and the access point (AP), b) an
unsaturated system having finite population of STAs, each having a finite buffer
capacity, c) a ring/bell shaped spatial distribution for the STAs, d) the basic and
ready to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) access mechanisms for IEEE 802.11 dis 
tributed coordination function (DCF) and enhanced DCF (EDCF), e) homoge 
neous/heterogeneous groups of STAs.
Finally, the performance analysis of WLAN system using IEEE 802.11 EDCF
as the access protocol with multiple parallel channels for transmission is presented.
Different channel selection schemes and channel configurations have been used in
the analysis and the results are presented.
