A method has been proposed to analyze the surfaces of the horizontally curved bridges in the form of tiles of varying thickness along the country direction using the difference method defined in one dimension with the method of forming the corresponding.This method has been programmed in a general program returned in the language of Fortran 88 so that it can be used easily. The accuracy of this method was verified using some of the analyzed examples. It has been shown that this method is accurate and that the program is easy to operate and economical in terms of run time or capacity required. A number of examples have been analyzed using the proposed method to study the effect of some changes on the behavior of the roofs of these bridges and on the distribution of internal strength. This method was also used to ascertain the accuracy of the simplified method of analysis of this type of bridges
