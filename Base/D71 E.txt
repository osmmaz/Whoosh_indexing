The polarizers are important elements o f integrated optical circuits. In this research
work, two types of metal clad TM pass polarizers, transmission mode polarizer
and reflection mode polarizer, are studied. In the first type, the T M polarized waves
are transmitted with low loss, while T E polarized wave are transmitted with very high
loss. The second type of polarizer has corrugations in its structure. I t functions by
reflecting T M waves with low loss, while the reflected TE polarized waves are highly
attenuated. The reflection and transmission spectra o f the reflection mode polarizer
are calculated fo r different high index buffer layer thicknesses, different number of
grating periods, different groove depths and different length o f metal clad section.
The Method o f Lines (MOL) with the Cascading and Doubling Algorithm is applied
to model the multi layer Waveguide structure with periodic corrugations. Higherorder
approximations of the second derivative (d2/ d x 2) operator with appropriate
interface conditions are used. The Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) absorber is used
to absorb the radiated fields due to the presence o f longitudinal discontinuities.
