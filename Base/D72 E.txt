The ARRO W {Antiresonant Relecting Optical Waveguide) waveguide is a basic
component of integrated optical circuits. In this thesis, multi layer A R R O W planar
waveguide is studied for the purpose of enhancing the evanescent field in low index
media. This leads to enhancing the sensitivity of optical detection in the low index
media. We have analyzed this structure using water as the low index superstrate
and investigated different aspects which include a study of the polarization properties,
sensitivity and coupling loss using endfire excitation. The sensiiivity of optical
detection and power enhancement of the evanescent field in the low index superstrate
of the multi layer A R R O W waveguide is sufficiently increased as the the core
thickness of the multi layer A R R O W waveguide is decreased. Gaussain beam coupling
problem which involves a single discontinuity is successfully analyzed using the
Method of Lines (MOL). The Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) absorber is used to
absorb the radiated fields from this discontinuities. The MOL with Higher order approximations
of the second derivative (EPfdxr) operator with appropriate interface
conditions are used in the analysis.
