In this thesis work, various one dimensional and two dimensional bandgap structures
are analyzed. In the one dimensional case, we analyzed a deep grating, symmetrically
coupled deep grating and asymmetrically coupled deep grating structures.
In the two dimensional case, we analyzed the presence of line defects and point
defects as well as a U turn line defect. In all the above bandgap structures, we calculated
the spectral response including modal reflectivity, modal transmissivity and
the loss due to radiation. Due to the fact that, we need to analyze very different
structures, an automated Method of Lines (MOL) program has been developed for
this purpose. This automaticated user friendly computer program which accounts
for arbitrary longitudinal discontinuities in a numerically efficient manner, is used
in the thesis work. The MOL with improved features is also discussed in this thesis
work. Improved implementation of the transverse second derivative operator and the
Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) are discussed.
In general, the spectral response of these structures give rise to interesting features
such as the presence of transmission resonances within the bandgap, which
make them potential candidates for use as compact wavelength filters.
