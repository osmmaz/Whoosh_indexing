The performance of an upflow packed bed biofilm reactor was analyzed under
single and multiple substrate utilization when subjected to various types of shock
loads of feed concentration and temperature. The response of the reactor to
sinusoidal and triangular perturbations of feed concentration and temperature was
analyzed under single substrate limitation. The question of oxygen becoming the
limiting substrate in the biofilm during organic oxidation was also addressed by
developing a bi substrate model considering both oxygen and organics as the
limiting substrate. The model was further extended to multiple substrate limiting
conditions by considering simultaneous organic oxidation and nitrification
reactions because of their obvious environmental significance. The performance of
the reactor under multiple substrate limitation was analysed by subjecting it to
four different types of shock loads of inlet feed concentration to determine
whether the reactor will be able to maintain the reqired effluent quality.
