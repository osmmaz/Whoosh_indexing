Analytical treatment of random multiple access systems with finite users and finite
buffers remains a very complex problem due to the interfering nature of the queues
through the shared medium. A new generalized analysis technique for buffered multiple
access systems, called tagged user analysis (TUA), was recently proposed. TUA
approach simplifies the analysis of buffered multiple access systems by exploiting the
redundancy in the system and treating each user as a queueing system in equilibrium.
In this thesis, TUA has been successfully applied to systems operating in wireless
channels where fading and signal path loss might considerably affect the system performance.
The performance of Slotted ALOHA and CSMA protocols operating in
a Rayleigh fading channel is analyzed. We also consider the effect of path loss and
random spatial distribution of users on the system performance. It is shown that
TUA analysis is not complicated by the complexity of the underlying channel. The
simulations results axe also provided to compare with the analysis.
