In this thesis, new strategies have been proposed to analyze the field around high pressure lines
Continuous mono polar current using the specific finite element method "is one of the main problems
For continuous high voltage lines, the halo is formed around the line connections The proposed strategies include not taking the "Dobch" hypothesis which suggests that the Albons
Located around line connections only affect the value of the electric field and not its direction. In addition to that the
Suggested strategies The ions on line connections have been deployed in the analysis process in the case of mono  lines
Polar and for the first time in bipolar lines. 
The strategies included, in addition to
It is proposed to propose a way of simulating the borderline connections to be in the end rather than
At the distance of a pyramid like the height of the line from the surface of the earth
