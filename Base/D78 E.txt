This thesis is concerned with the corona phenomenon on single  and multi phase
AC power transmission lines. Corona is a partial breakdown that occurs when the
conductor surface field exceeds the breakdown strength of the air. The discharge results
in production of positive and negative space charges which are constrained to the near
vicinity of the conductor because of the periodic reversal of the electric field. The
objective of this thesis is to calculate the corona power loss associated with high voltage
AC power transmission lines. The charge simulation technique is used to analyze the
ionized field in corona problems. The locations of the simulation charges represent
singularity points for which two approaches were proposed to calculate the potential and
field there. Calculations at singularity points were checked by solving the corona problem
in parallel plates, coaxial cylinders, monopolar line with single conductor, monopolar
line with bundle 2 conductor, and homopolar line arrangements. The calculation of
corona power loss on AC transmission lines includes single  and three phase lines as
well as the future six phase lines. The onset voltages have been calculated for the first
time in corona loss calculations based on the physics of gas discharge and by using
empirical formulae for the onset electric field. The emission of ions is assumed to take
place when the magnitude of the charge simulating the conductor and the ionization zone
charges exceeds an onset value based on a pre defined onset field value for both positive
and negative half cycles. The ground level electric field has been investigated to help
in studying the environmental impact of AC lines. The results obtained in this thesis
agreed satisfactorily with those reported earlier.
