The data obtained from the measurements of the flow properties of flow in a
confined, isothermal, swirling flowfield are analyzed for turbulent kinetic energy
terms. The axisymmetric flow measurements were carried out with a twocomponent
laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV). The main objective of this study
is to analyze a detailed experimental database to help in the understanding of
the behavior of swirled, axisymmetric, recirculating, turbulent flows. In addition,
the data from this study will be available for upgrading advanced design
codes. Furthermore, the influence of swirl number and swirl type on the flowfield
characteristics (e.g., turbulent kinetic energy terms: convection, diffusion,
dissipation, and production terms) are investigated. These terms were calculated
directly from the experimental data using central differencing. The contributions
of various components of the turbulent kinetic energy terms to the convection, diffusion,
dissipation, and production of the turbulent kinetic energy are presented,
as functions of radial and axial positions.
