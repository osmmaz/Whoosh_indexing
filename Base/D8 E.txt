The extensive use of modem nonlinear power electronic devices and nonlinear loads has
made the problem of harmonic distortion more challenging to researchers and utility
engineers. Estimation of these serious harmonic interferences is necessary for the analysis
and design of modem equipment and for the system security. The need for the effective
elimination of such unwanted frequency components becomes essential in power system
planning, analysis, and operation.
The work proposed in this thesis is two folds. In the first part, different frequency
components of a distorted signal have been estimated. Different estimation algorithms
were used and tested over standard signals with different frequency components present.
The robustness of the algorithms was tested in the context o f additive noise, for different
noise levels, corresponding to different signal to noise ratios (SNR).
In the second part of the thesis, two new filtering schemes for harmonic elimination are
proposed. These techniques have been studied for different types of practical signals
reported in the literature. The robustness of the schemes has been tested in context with
the additive noise of different SNRs. Apart from the simulation o f these techniques, the
prototype implementations on a small voltage scale are also presented and evaluated
based upon the criteria of robustness, accuracy, and reliability.
