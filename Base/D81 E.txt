The explicit finite difference scheme of DuFort Frankel
type which was successfully applied in buoyant Jet analysis by
previous investigators is now applied to solve partial differential
equations of continuity, momentum, energy and salinity to
simulate a warm, dense, highly salt laden Jet issuing from desalination
plant outfall systems. Turbulent shear stress, heat
flux, and component of mass flux term appearing in the governing
equations are evaluated using an eddy viscosity model which
includes effects such as intermittent turbulence near the edge of
the Jet and buoyancy on mixing. The turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt
numbers used to relate the turbulent exchange of momentum
and scalar constituents are kept constant at 0.7 for all calculations
reported.
The following flow categories are considered: (1) The
vertical dense Jet discharging into quiescent, uniform or stratified
ambient, and (2) the dense Jet discharging horizontally or
inclined to the horizontal into a uniform or stratified ambient.
The predictions of Jet trajectory in the lower Froude number
range agree favorably with the available experimental data.
For higher densimetrie Froude numbers, significant deviation between
predictions and experiments is observed. However, the experimental
data is very limited and additional data is needed before any
conclusive remarks can be made.
