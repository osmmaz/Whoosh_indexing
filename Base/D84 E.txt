In this thesis, the flow of fluid and the transfer of temperature varies with time around and inside
Fluid ball using numerical differences method
This study is based on the theory of the adjacent layer and the equations of fluid flow were separated from equations
Heat transfer by determining the values of the velocity and temperature variables at the surface of the ball. Two programs have been designed
One analyzes the flow of fluid and the transfer of heat around the ball and the other by the analysis inside the ball. it's done
Use the first program results such as speed and temperature change around the surface of the ball over time as data
Of the other program
