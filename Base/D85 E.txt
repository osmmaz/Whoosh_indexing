Image processing has been receiving extensive atten tio n in recent years because o f its
potential applications to a num ber o f fields. Video, Audio, and Im ages produce vast
am ount o f data which requires a tremendous am ount o f m em ory fo r its storage, and
could not possibly be faithfully transm itted due to channel bandwidth lim itation. The
only solution is to compress the data involved. S ix new algorithm s are proposed
fo r the data compression problem. Comparisons are m ade w ith an im plem ented
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based compression method. One o f the algorithms
is modified and applied to a speech signal. The perform ance and evaluation o f these
new algorithms are addressed based on fidelity criteria, and im plem ented examples
are given.
