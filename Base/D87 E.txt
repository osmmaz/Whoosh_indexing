In this thesis an acceleration potential (source)
is used to investigate the effect of force distribution on
the generation and decay of the bow shock waves due to delta wings
with straight and curved leading edges in a supersonic flow
field. Formulas for the bow shock strength are derived for an
observer perpendicular below the wing and for the lateral
direction as well.
It is concluded that the equivalent body of revolution
is valid throughout the supersonic far flow field. The decay
of the shock waves is predicted for the observer in the plane
vertical to the wing.
Also the position of the characteristics is corrected
up to first order.
