expanding the tube into the tubesheet. Tube rolling is the most popular form o f expansion.
However, uniform pressure expansion has been often assumed in the studies o f the jo in t
strength. The jo in t strength is influenced by many factors such as the method o f
attachment, m aterial properties, geometry and dimensions. To sim plify the analysis,
researchers have assum ed zero initial radial clearance and elastic perfectly plastic
m aterial in the study o f the jo in t strength.
In this thesis, fin ite elem ent analysis is conducted on axisymmetric, plane stress and plane
strain models to investigate the effect o f initial radial clearance and tube strain hardening
on the residual contact pressure between the tube and tubesheet hole after expanding the
tube by applying uniform pressure. Results show that the radial clearance has a negative
effect on the jo in t strength. The effect becomes more significant with increasing the level
o f tube strain hardening. A practical equation to calculate the reduction factor due to the
initial radial clearance and tube strain hardening, which could be used with the closedform
solution o f the residual contact pressure available in the literature, is proposed
O ther equations fo r calculating the tube’s inner and outer surfaces radial deformation,
which are used to calculate the tube wall reduction and tube thinning, are also proposed
The results obtained from the fin ite element analysis are compared with the
experim entally measured results, which were conducted on roller expanded tubes into a
nine holes square block. Because o f the low level o f tube strain hardening, experimental
results show that the jo in t strength seems to be unaffected by the initial radial clearance.
