Multimedia applications require real time quality of service assurance. Such
applications need a well understanding of the data network they ride on. The performance
of the data network also needs to be closely monitored to know what impact the
application has and whether or not the network is capable of carrying it. However, due to
the fact that today’s data network runs many critical applications, data network engineers
seek for a way to measure the impact of these applications before deploying them. This
thesis will focus on VoIP as the multimedia application. We will assess the readiness of
existing networks to support VoIP using an analytical simulator. Although there are some
simulation tools that attempt to measure network readiness but there are no tools
available that measure VoIP network readiness using mathematical analysis. Therefore
the major contribution of this master thesis is to design and implement such a tool. We
will also highlight the advantages of mathematical analysis and the drawbacks of
simulation tools. Our tool will ask the user for the network topology of the current
network and using delay and throughput analysis it will generate a report identifying the
number of calls the network can support and the bottleneck. We will also compare our
results with results obtained using a simulation tool such as OPNET.
