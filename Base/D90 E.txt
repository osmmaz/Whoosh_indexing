Component Based System (CBS) development is increasingly becoming popular for
software development. Using components in developing software systems can have a
potential benefits such as decrease development cost, increase software productivity,
reliability, as well as improve the quality of the final products. But can also involve a
series of limitations. However, black box nature of components introduces unique
challenge at the integration phase of a CBS. It is well known that there is a correlation
between the number of faults found in software and its complexity. Components
complexity measures have been used to identify possible faults in individual components
and subsequently perform a risk assessment of the system. The aim of this work is to
empirically investigate the usefulness of structure complexity measures to improve
Component Base (CB) integration testing (glue code) in terms of defect detection
effectiveness and effort. We ran three controlled experiments with students from King
Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, to evaluate the effectiveness of structure
complexity measures in CB integration testing (glue code testing). Experiments results
indicate that the adoption of structure complexity measures led to a significant better
detecting of the faults during CB integration testing without requiring a significant
additional effort. Finally, subject experience doesn't have any effect on the defect
detection effectiveness.
