A Honeynet is a network designed by the Honeynet Project organization to gather information on security threats. Honeynet is a controlled network of vulnerable computers (honeypots) and is being used by organizations to proactively improve their network security as it is designed to identify malicious traffic and unauthorized activities on the network. Honeynet captures a substantial amount of data and logs for analysis in order to identify malicious activities. The analysis of this large amount of data is a challenging task. The main aim of this work is to use an anomaly detection technique to detect new and unknown attacks using data collected by Honeynets. In this work we propose an anomaly detection technique that will efficiently analyze the Honeynet data and will help in learning the behavior and techniques used by the hackers. In this work, we have used feature based and volume based schemes to identify anomalies in Honeynet traffic. A detailed analysis of various traffic features were carried out and the most appropriate features for Honeynet traffic were selected. The anomaly detection was done by using threshold values of entropy distributions for feature based parameters and volume changes for volume based parameters. The behavior of various anomalies was defined using the selected features and their respective threshold values. In this work, we show that our proposed technique which utilizes both feature based and volume based parameters is effective in detecting most types of anomalies seen in Honeynets.
