The current power grid is outdated and overwhelmed by the increase in demand
for power. The advent of the smart grid presents a new paradigm that will solve
this problem and also provide several unique functionalities to the consumers. The
smart grid is envisioned to be a completely automated infrastructure that will re 
quire little or no human intervention. This will be made possible due to the in 
tegration of latest information and communications technologies (ICT) into the
power grid. The various sensors installed in the smart grid will have the capa 
bility to report back information related to power consumption, billing and other
significant readings. However, this integration of technology also raises several
concerns about the cyber protection of the smart grid. The security challenges
presented by the smart grid are unique and cannot be overcome with existing so 
xi
lutions. This work presents a novel intrusion detection technique for the smart
grid infrastructure that is capable of detecting malicious activity at different lev 
els of the smart grid hierarchy. In addition signatures of anomalous smart grid
behaviors are formulated to improve detection rate.
