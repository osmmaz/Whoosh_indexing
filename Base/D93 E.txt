In th is thesis we introduce th e annuli of a fuzzy subgroup and use it as a tool
to give a lte rn ate proofs of some properties of fuzzy subgroups and to straighten
out som e known results on fuzzy norm al and fuzzy abelian groups and obtain some
new results about them. It is also used to describe th e left and right fuzzy cosets
determ ined by a fuzzy subgroup.
We o b ta in some com m utative diagram s which relate to hom om orphism s, fuzzy
subgroups and fuzzy quotient groups. Finally, we straig h ten out some chains of
fuzzy norm al subgroups which lead to the concept of fuzzy solvable groups.
