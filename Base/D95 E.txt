This research aims to solve the problem of intersection traffic flow prediction along with
the determination of time of day (TOD) break points for a pre timed or actuated
intersection. This study investigated mainly three artificial intelligence based models
namely group method of data handling (GMDH) model, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference
system (ANFIS) model and type 2 fuzzy logic (FL) model to predict intersection traffic
flow considering spatial and temporal characteristics. It is observed that that fuzzy cmeans
(FCM) clustering algorithm based ANFIS models and type 2 FL models
outperform other considered models for two approaches of the considered intersection.
Based on the obtained performance measures, it can be concluded that all the considered
models are valid and promising for predicting traffic flow. This study also proposes a
novel methodology in which time variable and Z score of the approach traffic counts are
used as the prospective features for determining TOD breakpoints instead of relying on
the judgmental approach. The obtained results solve the problem of frequent changes of
TODs. At the end, this study proposes a hybrid AI model consists of AIM, ANFIS, type 
2 and artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting freeway traffic flow for the local
freeway condition of Saudi Arabia.
