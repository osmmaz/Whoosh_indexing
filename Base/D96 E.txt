This project was designed at laboratory scale to study the influence of using
three commercial enzymes as a bioremediation tool to treat/ recover ground
water from EDC and Oil. The project designed at the laboratory to simulate the
real environmental condition of ground water at semi aquifer geological
structure. The objective of using enzymes is to increase the bioremediation
process to treat ground water from EDC and oil by increasing the activities of
the microorganisms which exist in the natural water. EDC and oil contaminate
ground water as results of leaching through soil due the industrial accidents
which were recorded during the previous 30 years. Due to the low Solubility of
EDC in water (0.869 g/100 ml at 20 C) and its high density, it dominated in the
low layers of water and stay for long time before it treated naturally. On the
other hand, oil take also long time for natural remediation.
