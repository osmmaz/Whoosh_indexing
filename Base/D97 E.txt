Seismic attributes can be used in seismic interpretation. As seismic data quality
improves, interpretation of seismic attributes becomes more reliable. Seismic attributes reveal
information that often cannot be detected in conventional seismic displays. The attributes can
be used for both quantitative and qualitative interpretation of any zone of interest
The main goal of this study is to estimate porosity, water saturation, and volume of silt
using several seismic attributes and then arrive at getting one conclusion based on the quantitative
and the qualitative analyses.
In the quantitative analysis, nine seismic attributes are used to estimate the reservoir
properties mentioned above. These attributes are calculated and averaged over the zone of
interest, from Base Khuff to Pre Unayzah Unconformity, compared to the log derived reservoir
properties from 19 wells. Multi variant regression is used to approximate a linear transformation
between seismic attributes and reservoir properties. Then the transformation is applied to the
whole seismic data.
In the qualitative analysis, spectral attributes are studied in addition to the nine seismic
attributes discussed in the quantitative analysis. Attributes are related to the reservoir properties
qualitatively. Both the quantitative and the qualitative interpretation are in agreement.
I preserved two wells for validation purposes. The estimated reservoir properties of
these two wells using Multi seismic attributes approach are in agreement with the well driven
reservoir properties.The multi seismic attributes driven reservoir properties method was
compared to the single attribute method and to a method utilizing simple kriging of well information.
