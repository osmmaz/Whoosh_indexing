Alternate adsorption of polyanion and polycation onto a substrate through layer by
layer (LbL) assembly provides a convenient mean of depositing ultrathin film with
controlled thicknesses and compositions. Spin assisted layer by layer (SA LbL) assembly
was introduced to reduce processing time and improve layering quality. This dissertation
explores the use of SA LbL assembly in particular for fabricating reverse osmosis (RO)
membrane.
The effect several parameters such as molecular weight of polyelectrolyte,
concentration of polyelectrolyte solution, spin speed, and ionic strength of polyelectrolyte
solution has been thoroughly investigated. However; the effect of pH for this particular
technique has not been investigated yet whereas pH is one of the most important
parameter for controlling film properties. This dissertation also investigated the effect of
pH coupled with other parameters such as spin speed and concentration. Four different polyelectrolyte membrane systems such as poly(diallyldiamine
ammonium chloride) (PDAC) /poly(vinyl sulfate) (PVS); poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
