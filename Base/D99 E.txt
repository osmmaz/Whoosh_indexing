Well test model identification and, subsequently, model parameters determination is
more complex in horizontal wells as compared to vertical wells. This is due to the increase
in number o f flow regimes occurring during a flow period and due to the fact that
strong correlation exists between model parameters.
This study presents a new approach fo r automatic model identification and computeraided
well test interpretation in horizontal wells. The new approach is based on using
neural network to (1) identify the well test interpretation model; (2) identify flow regimes;
and (3) mark the position o f identified flow regions on the derivative plot o f well
test data.
This work consists o f first generating common model signatures using Ozkan and Ragavan
analytical solutions fo r horizontal well in various reservoir and inner boundary
conditions assuming laterally boundless reservoir. Next, these signatures are used to
train neural networks fo r three identification stages, namely, model identification, flow
regime identification, and position o f flow regime identification. Separate networks were
trained, then tested and validated using synthetic as well as field data. Once the three
identification stages are completed, specialized plots for data points falling into each
flow regime are used to determine initial model parameters. Finally, non linear regression
software was used to determine final model parameters.
A comparative study was carried out using different network architectures and data
preparation schemes. Modular approach with direct data utilization is found to be most
suitable fo r field implementation o f our approach.
